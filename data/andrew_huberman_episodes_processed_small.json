                "transcript": "you there let's talk about treatments for ADHD and why stimulant treatments in particular can be so effective first of all it's long been known that there are specific brain networks involved in what we call attention now attention is not one thing actually it involves several different cognitive operations including the suppression of noise that is turning down the background chatter in our heads and turning down our attending to things outside us like noises or visual cues that are not relevant to what we want to do and it also involves ramping up or attending we're focusing on particular things that are happening either in our immediate environment or in our head or both so if that all sounds rather complex indeed it is it involves several different networks operating in parallel but what we know for sure based on a lot of clinical and scientific laboratory data is that the so-called prefrontal cortex the region of neural real estate in your brain just behind your forehead is critically important for orchestrating which neural circuits are going to be more or less active at a given moment in order to bring about what we call Focus or attention or task switching or our ability indeed to multitask because we can actually multitask to some extent in fact if you were to look at somebody and focus on perhaps the expression on their face you could do that while also attending to a conversation that's happening nearby it's energetically demanding it's hard to do but we can do that that's actually referred to as covert attention you're covertly paying attention to something else and then you can switch that attention back to just one thing or one small collection of things the point being that attention is a powerful resource it's what allows us to navigate through life with efficiency and to be adaptive in our behaviors it's what allows us to learn and to build relationships and have successful School careers and professional careers and so on but it is indeed expensive it takes metabolic resources you know just at rest if you were to think about essentially nothing or whatever just pops into your mind with no dedicated effort toward paying attention to anything your brain would consume about 25 of your daily caloric needs and then when you lump on top of that your need or your attempts to focus on things to pay attention to specific things should come as no surprise as to why that often can make us feel tired as if we've been working really hard and we've been running a quote unquote mental marathon when trying to learn and attend to things it's hard work for the brain and yet we can pay attention because of that very precious real estate just behind our foreheads the prefrontal cortex now in people both children and adults that have ADHD their prefrontal cortex is not necessarily deficient in any specific way except that it is not as good at orchestrating the activity of other brain networks operating in parallel with it what do I mean by that well if we take a step back and say what is the prefrontal cortex really doing the prefrontal cortex has this amazing ability through what's called top-down inhibition to quiet other brain areas so for instance if you are feeling agitated but you need to sit still your ability to sit still even if it takes a bit of work is coordinated by your prefrontal cortex sending inhibitory suppressive electrical signals to the networks of your brain that are trying to generate physical action in addition to that if you are in a conversation that's either a difficult one or a boring one or you are tempted to interrupt and you are actively holding back your desire to walk away or to yawn or to blurt something out it's your prefrontal cortex that is controlling that active suppression so in many ways you can just think of the prefrontal cortex as an Orchestra conductor that is essentially saying shh or not right now be quiet this is not the time to many different brain networks all at once now in addition to that your prefrontal cortex is coordinating with other brain networks that are involved in generating what's called salience or attention to particular signals so the prefrontal cortex in many ways is like a teacher or an Orchestra conductor it can point to in the neurochemical sense that is 0.2 a given brain structure and say you I'd like to hear more from you right now yes you the student in the back speak up and a moment later point to a collection of small students chattering in the back again I'm presenting all this by analogy and say hey hey you guys quiet down right now so and so is going to come up to the front of the room and help us work through this particular math problem so when we hear that the prefrontal cortex exerts what's called executive function what that refers to is the prefrontal cortex's ability to quiet the activity of particular neural circuits and to enhance or increase the salience of other neural circuits that are involved in creating our Spotlight of attention and what we know for sure based on many many brain Imaging studies is that ADHD is not necessarily A deficit in prefrontal cortical function but rather the prefrontal cortex's ability to communicate with other brain areas in the proper ways and so what results in the brain of a person either young or old with ADHD is that a lot of the background chatter becomes very very loud so for instance we have a brain Network called the default mode Network this is a fascinating brain Network this is the brain Network that is active when you just sort of sit in place and don't think about much and then you start having ideas about what you might do next week it tends to be very autobiographical so you might remember an experience from the past you might think about some of your desires some of your dislikes this default mode Network as it's called is also involved in our imagination our in our spooling together of different experiences that we've had it doesn't tend to be the thing that's really focused on anything external in particular all at once the default mode network is always active but it's when we start to attend to something especially things external to us like it you know something written on a page or a conversation or something that we really need to learn something we need to pay attention to that the activity of the default mode network is suppressed somewhat and that suppression occurs not just by accident but because the prefrontal cortex is actively suppressing it in kids and adults with ADHD the default mode network is often still active at a very robust level even while we're trying to attend to things and that's why someone with ADHD will sit down and try and do some focused work and I'll start thinking about something they want or something they dislike their internal state will start to distract them and of course there are other networks in the brain there's actually a what's called a true salience Network there's the dorsal attention Network there are a bunch of different networks and brain areas but again when thinking about ADHD and especially when thinking about how the drugs that we're going to talk about today work to alleviate the symptoms of ADHD and in thinking about why so many people use or even abuse these drugs for sake of learning or recreationally we might say you start to realize that everything centers back to the prefrontal cortex and the prefrontal cortex's ability to actively suppress and actively enhance the activity of these multiple brain networks including default mode networks aliens Network dorsal attention Network Etc so rather than overwhelm you with a bunch of names of brain areas and brain networks today I'd really like our discussion to focus on first what the various drugs that are used to treat ADHD are that is how do they work at the level of neurons second how they create a certain set of conditions that allow their prefrontal cortex to be a better conductor third how that can be leveraged during development to actually teach the prefrontal cortex of a young child to learn to be a better conductor because that's really the Hallmark of the use of these drugs is to try and enhance the activity of particular circuits to create a sort of learning so that the prefrontal cortex is much more efficient at doing its job of conducting and then fourth we're going to talk about the various things that I think most people out there ask about when they hear about drugs like Adderall Vyvanse and Ritalin Etc which is you know are they addictive why are they addictive can one use them briefly or even from time to time and still be okay what if I use them as a child and I don't want to be on them anymore should I put my child on these drugs Etc it is I believe only by understanding the biology of how these drugs work and their potential both to improve brain function but also some of the dangers associated with these drugs that one can really answer those questions for themselves or for their children okay so let's start with a very basic",

                "transcript": "okay so let's start with a very basic but critical question which is why in the world would amphetamines speed or other stimulants improve the symptoms of ADHD that's so critical to answer because if you think about it the prefrontal cortex needs to coordinate the actions of these other circuits and so just increasing the amount of activity in prefrontal cortex you can imagine would create a state of hyper Focus perhaps but actually that's not the case if you just were to ramp up the activity of prefrontal Cortex what you would find is that somebody would become even less efficient at paying attention to what they wanted to rather they would pay attention to whatever was presented in front of them with laser focus they would lock on to essentially anything and that's not good one of the key things about prefrontal cortex is that it needs to be flexible it needs to be able to pay attention to this then it needs to be able to pay attention to that then it needs to go back to paying attention to the thing it was paying attention to previously and so on and so forth life that is an effective adaptive life a good life consists of self-directing one's attention most all of the time so why would stimulants do that well almost all not all but almost all of the drugs used to treat ADHD fall under the category of stimulants or what are called sympathomimetics sympathomimetic refers to the fact that we naturally have a component of our nervous system called the autonomic nervous system the autonomic nervous system has two major components one is called the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system has nothing to do with sympathy has everything to do with ramping up our level of attention and arousal it is the so-called fight or flight aspect of our nervous system or rather it mediates fight or flight but immediates a bunch of other things too including sexual arousal including excitement and focus about something that we want to learn or somebody that we want to learn more about or remembering a phone number or anything that puts us into a state of alertness and focus the other arm of the autonomic nervous system is the so-called parasympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system and that's often referred to as the so-called rest and digest component of our nervous system and yes it controls rest indeed it puts us into sleep and yes it's involved in digestion but it's involved in a bunch of other things as well including sexual arousal including rates of digestion including salivation including all sorts of things that don't just have to do with resting and digesting the way to think about the autonomic nervous system is it's a sort of seesaw so it's always at a balance someplace between either predominantly sympathetic or predominantly parasympathetic but both the parasympathetic and the sympathetic arms of the autonomic nervous system are always active all the time it's not as if one is completely active and the others shut off even in sleep your sympathetic nervous system is not completely turned off and even during a panic attack your parasympathetic nervous system is not completely turned off drugs to treat ADHD which are fall under the category of stimulants are sympathomimetics because they trigger the release of neurochemicals and the activation of components of our nervous system that very much resemble the activation of the so-called sympathetic nervous system the one that makes us more alert and more aroused so that's why they're called sympathomimetics and the word stimulant refers to a general category of drugs that are sympathomimetics now the most commonly discussed sympathomimetic is one that fortunately is not prescribed for ADHD and that's methamphetamine these days we hear a lot about meth meth which is methylated amphetamine is an extremely potent sympathomimetic and it has tremendous abuse potential Believe It or Not meth or Methamphetamine is actually available as a prescription drug but it is used very rarely because of its high abuse potential and all the terrible things that it can do in terms of cardiovascular health in terms of oral health right there's this stereotype that meth users have very degraded teeth and indeed they do there's a reason for that related to how meth impacts the brain and body I'm going to talk a little bit about methamphetamine a little bit later but let's just Place methamphetamine high on the Shelf as the most potent sympathomimetic that's out there because even though it's not often prescribed for ADHD there are class of compounds very similar to it that have a very similar pattern of action that is not quite as potent but that leverages the same underlying mechanisms and they are very commonly prescribed for ADHD namely Adderall and Vyvanse so first let's talk about Adderall and what",

                "transcript": "in the brain it's worth taking a couple of minutes to think about how sympathomimetics such as adderall actually increase dopamine and norepinephrine they do so by affecting a couple of specific operations at the so-called synapse what are synapses synapses are the communication points between neurons they're actually the spaces between neurons but that's where a lot of the action is when neurons as we say are stimulating the next neuron or activating the next neuron or inhibiting the next neuron the word neuron just simply refers to nerve cell and so what nerve cells have is they have a cell body that contains their DNA and a bunch of other stuff they have a long wire like process which is referred to as an axon and at the end of that axon there are a bunch of proteins in there that do really interesting things so for instance there are proteins down at the end of the axon that package neurotransmitter into little spherical things that we call vesicles those vesicles can fuse with the end of the axon and vomit the contents those neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft into that little space between neurons and then if enough of those neurotransmitters bind to receptors on What's called the postsynaptic side which simply means the neuron on the other side well then the next neuron will become active and then the signal will propagate from one neuron to the next now I just described that whole process pretty quickly and I like to think pretty simply but it actually involves a lot of different protein bits and some pretty complex Machinery in order to make that happen I don't want to over complicate our conversation but what I will tell you is that down in the synapse in the presynaptic terminal the neuron that is going to release neurotransmitter there are what are called Transporters which sit there and suck up or suck back up some of the neurotransmitter that's been released there are dopamine Transporters and there are norepinephrine or noradrenergic Transporters down in the synapse what Adderall does and what other sympathomimetics do is to inhibit or disrupt the action of those Transporters and the net consequence of that is that when dopamine and or epinephrine are released into the synapse more of it is allowed to stick around and to binder receptors on the postsynaptic cell than would be the case if Adderall or the other stimulant were not present in the system so one way that Adderall increases dopamine and norepinephrine is by disrupting the activity of these presynaptic Transporters for dopamine and norepinephrine the other way that Adderall increases dopamine and norepinephrine is that it disrupts the activity of a different piece of Machinery in the presynaptic neuron which is called a vmat the vesicle monoamine transporter 2. if you really want to get specific you don't have to remember these names but what these vmats do is actually really cool what they do is they actually take whatever transmitter has been brought back up into the cell by Transporters and they package it into those vesicles that are then going to be released by disrupting the Transporters that vacuum back up some of the dopamine or norepinephrine that's been released and by also disrupting the packaging of dopamine and norepinephrine into vesicles themselves what ends up happening is that there's a buildup of a lot more dopamine and norepinephrine in the presynaptic terminal so that when an electrical signal travels down the neuron now the total amount of dopamine and norepinephrine that's released is increased okay so what's happening when you take Adderall is that you're getting more out of the dopamine and norepinephrine that you're releasing and you're releasing more dopamine and norepinephrine altogether and there's a third mechanism by which Adderall increases the amount of dopamine and norepinephrine present in synapses and therefore can act on other neurons and that has to do with disruption of the entire network between these different proteins I'm not going to go into that in any detail because it gets somewhat complicated in terms of the cell biology and some of the biochemistry down at the tips of these axons but suffice to say that Adderall is such an effective sympathomimetic that is it can increase dopamine to such a great extent especially compared to other treatments for ADHD because of its ability to increase dopamine release and transmission and therefore action as well as noradrenergic release and transmission and action down there in the synapse and it's worth pointing out that most of the effect of Adderall is an increasing dopamine as opposed to norepinephrine it does increase norepinephrine but its major effects we should say the major effects that have made it such an attractive drug to so many people both for the treatment of ADHD and for people to take recreationally or off prescription or for sake of studying or work simply because they want to focus more and longer is because of its ability to increase dopamine to such a great extent I'd like to take a quick break and",

                "transcript": "mostly dopamine so if we take a step back for a moment from all these drugs and all this cell biology of neurons and so forth and we go back to the brain networks involved in attention remember the orchestra model or the teacher model where the prefrontal cortex really sits in top seat in terms of coordinating the actions both the quieting and the yes please speak actions of the brain really bringing about what we think of as focused attention and task switching all the stuff that goes along with learning and focus and cognition well what we know is that dopamine and norepinephrine which are differentially increased by these different drugs that we've been talking about also differentially impact the various aspects of executive function of the prefrontal cortex increasing our attention for specific things and while there is a lot of nuance in the literature about this we can safely say a couple of things first of all increasing dopamine at particular synapses and networks in the brain can serve as what's called noise reduction it can help further enhance the quieting of all that background stuff that background stuff can be attention to things in your environment like noises or visual cues it could be some internal narrative that you had about yesterday or something that somebody said about you or something that somebody you like would like to say about you or whatever it might be that's happening in your head that's distracting you as well as your representation of your internal bodily State what we call interoception this is a really important aspect of attention that we don't often hear about which is that we have the ability to attend to things outside of us which is called exteroception as well as an ability to attend to things inside of us which include things like thoughts but also includes you know for instance how empty or full our gut feels whether or not we're comfortable in our chair you know when we think about the practice of focus and learning or focusing as a verb it involves often forcing ourselves to sit still it often involves us suppressing the fact that our foot is a little bit cramped or that we might need to use the restroom for you know we might want to delay that for 10-15 minutes even though it might be fairly urgent all these sorts of things are Central to our ability to attend and focus and so dopamine while it does many different things in the brain many many different things one of its main functions in the context of all this prefrontal cortex and attention stuff is to quiet the amount of noise that is it helps the prefrontal cortex suppress the signals that would otherwise distract us into thinking about oh yeah I'm kind of thirsty right now or I need to use the restroom or I really want to make this caller I really really want to pick up my phone all of that stuff all of that suppression that shh that quieting down of all the background chatter related to things external and internal to us in our head and our body is greatly facilitated by having more dopamine present in the synapses that allow for what we call noise reduction now in parallel to that is norepinephrine norepinephrine is released from multiple sites in the brain and body but within the brain there's one major site of neurons that manufacture norepinephrine and the name of that site is Locus ceruleus it sits in the back of the brain it's actually a relatively small collection of neurons but they are very very powerful they extend their little axons their wires to multiple locations in the brain and they release norepinephrine at those locations so think of them sort of as a sprinkler system that originates from one very focal location but that can sprinkle norepinephrine at multiple locations in the brain and the amazing thing about Locus ceruleus and that sprinkler system is that indeed the sprinkler system can be pretty widespread where everywhere there's a sprinkler head somebody's getting norepinephrine but it also can fairly focally release norepinephrine at particular sites so while in the context of today's discussion dopamine is acting largely to impart noise reduction norepinephrine has the ability to boost signals at synapses to increase the amplitude and frequency of communication between neurons and in that way in the context of today's discussion norepinephrine when released at the particular synapses in the particular brain networks that are related to attention and learning is largely serving to increase signal so what we have in the context of a drug like Adderall or vivance or to some extent methylphenidate Ritalin does this as well is an increase in dopamine and neuro epinephrine that is leading to two things both a reduction in noise a quieting of the circuitry that we don't want to hear so much from and an increase in the signal of the networks that we do want to pay attention to and the net effect of that noise reduction and Signal amplification is what the engineers refer to as increased signal to noise and the consequence of that is a heightened subjective sense or ability to decide what we want to focus on sit down or stand there and just focus on it so the way that we've been discussing",

                "transcript": "so the way that we've been discussing drugs to treat ADHD and their ability to increase dopamine and norepinephrine and thereby to reduce the amount of noise so to speak in the brain and to increase the amount of signal related to things that we want to attend to all presumes that the amount of dopamine and the amount of norepinephrine that's being increased is perfect for what we want to accomplish which is increased focus and reduced hyperactivity and impulsivity but of course in the real world that's not always the case depending on the dosage of the drug one sensitivity to the drug even what stage of development across the lifespan a person is at things can really go Haywire pretty fast and what I'm referring to when I say Haywire is if you think about dopamine and its ability to reduce noise well dopamine does a bunch of other things as well and in fact we know that if dopamine is increased too much in the brain somebody that has ADHD or somebody that doesn't have ADHD people can become euphoric people can become manic people can even become psychotic likewise if norepinephrine is increased too much people won't just become alert they will become very anxious have panic attacks and depending on the drug they're taking they may even experience very serious peripheral symptoms meaning elevated heart rate and sweating that is super uncomfortable and on and on so everything I've been discussing up until now is true but I want to make it clear that it's true in the context of appropriately dosed prescribed drug for a given condition which leads us to the next question which is why would it be that giving these drugs which are in fact stimulants why would that calm a kid down why would that common adult with ADHD down and the answer to that is not completely straightforward and it is worth pointing out that not everyone with ADHD has impulsivity and hyperactivity and therefore an inability to focus some kids and adults with ADHD do have challenges with impulsivity and hyperactivity some do not some just have challenges with focus and I did an entire episode about ADHD and we are going to have an expert guest on this podcast who specializes in the treatment of ADHD to talk about some of these issues further but I just want to remind everybody that as in the general population children and adults with ADHD are capable of very concentrated periods of focus the pattern however tends to be that children and adults with ADHD have a harder time getting into that state of focus and perhaps most importantly they have a very hard time getting into a forced state of focus for things that they don't enjoy doing I'm sure many of you are also thinking wait I don't like to do certain things and it's harder to focus on those things than on the things I like of course does that mean I have ADHD and the answer is not necessarily so kids and adults with ADHD exhibit an extreme variation in their ability to focus such that if there's something they really really like doing they can indeed Focus however for many many other activities that are required in order to develop I guess we'll just call it normal life advancement so sitting still listening to conversations that we may not be particularly interested in that's where the challenges come about so the point is that these brain networks and these neuromodulators like dopamine and norepinephrine that we've been talking about in Fairly straightforward terms as it relates to a Drug's ability to increase their transmission and therefore an improved ability of focus presumes two things it presumes that the dosing is right that is that the levels of increases in these neuromodulators is just right and I also just want to acknowledge that ADHD is first of all not an inability to focus at all it is immense challenges in focusing on lots of different things as required for normal life progression and it's also the case that there is no one specific pattern of ADHD that applies to everyone with ADHD some people both kids and adults will exhibit the hyperactivity but not the impulsivity although those two things tend to go hand in hand some people will have a challenge in focus without hyperactivity impulsivity and so forth and all this just really speaks to the complexity of ADHD and yet and yet we can confidently say that there are more drugs to treat ADHD than any other psychiatric condition we've talked about a few of those now but among those Adderall vivance Ritalin also called methylphenol State there are time release versions there are different variations on those time release versions there's even straight dexedrine which is prescribed for ADHD in some cases and on and on and you might also find it interesting to know that that very large kit of drugs all of which at least the ones we've talked about so far are sympathome addicts or stimulants are more effective at treating ADHD than are any other collection of drugs for treating other psychiatric disorders so what all of that diversity of symptomology and ADHD as well as differences in sensitivity to drugs and individual variation what all of that speaks to is that the large kit of drugs that's out there is designed to be assessed with the careful consult of a very qualified psychiatrist in order to allow the child or adult to arrive at the specific drug and the specific dosage that's ideal for their particular pattern of ADHD and that issue actually",

                "transcript": "pattern of ADHD and that issue actually gives rise to the answer to that now somewhat age-old question as to why giving stimulants to a kid that is hyperactive would calm them down and the answer is that the hyperactivity impulsivity and focus issues present in ADHD in children and adults are the consequence not necessarily of deficient activity of neural circuits in the prefrontal cortex or deficient activity of the default mode Network or deficient activity of the salience network Etc what appears to be the case based on a lot of high quality neuroimaging data is that the brains of children and adults with ADHD have all of these networks functioning but those networks are actually hyper connected that is they tend to be co-active at times when ordinarily meaning kids and adults without ADHD they would not be co-active so that's an important point because it's easy to get the impression that ADHD is just a deficiency in dopamine and norepinephrine and that's simply not the case if you recall dopamine and norepinephrine are neuromodulators they modulate the activity of other neural circuits and they can both increase and decrease activity within those circuits so you don't necessarily want to think about dopamine and norepinephrine just as molecules that increase neural activity and you certainly don't want to think about ADHD it's just a deficiency in dopamine or deficiency in norepinephrine the way these drugs work when they are used effectively to treat ADHD is to tune the amount of dopamine and norepinephrine that are present in particular brain networks in order to allow the person to arrive at just the right balance between the activation of these different neural circuits causing them largely to be less synchronous in their firing so this takes us back to this question why giving stimulants to a kid would calm them down it's not so much that you're giving a stimulant to a kid to place them into a state of calm I think that's a common misconception rather by increasing dopamine and norepinephrine these drugs yes increase levels of overall autonomic arousal they are after all sympathomimetics but more importantly to the treatment of ADHD symptoms you are activating the prefrontal cortex in a way that allows it to be more of a coordinator of that Orchestra conductor or if you prefer the analogy to a teacher in the classroom to ramp up the activity of certain neural circuits in a given moment and quiet down the activity of other neural circuits such that the default mode Network can still perform its incredible actions after all the default mode network is involved not just in self-referencing and kind of daydreaming but also creativity and Imagination that's been well described in the literature as well as the salience network and these other networks that are designed to drop us into very narrow trenches of attention these drugs for the treatment of ADHD are are indeed stimulants but the goal of prescribing these drugs to a child or adult with ADHD is to adjust dosage timing and the duration over which somebody takes it in their lifespan in order to allow those neural circuits to work in the proper way meaning for the conductor to activate the instruments in that little symphony or band in the appropriate order in order to arrive at the right music as opposed to all the instruments playing at once which would just be complete noise or if again if you prefer the classroom teaching analogy for the teacher to call on one student while the others are quiet and then to call on a different student have one student return to their seats to have the students work in small groups again all of this by analogy the point being that dopamine and norepinephrine are all allowing these networks to be activated to the precisely correct levels and in the precisely correct sequence now the other key aspect of drugs like Adderall",

                "transcript": "arise a question that comes up from time to time when discussing the long-term effects of drugs like Adderall Ritalin and vivance is whether or not they can negatively impact height or growth or development in some other way this is a logical question to ask because after all these drugs are effectively mimicking stress in the body and most everyone is heard by now that while stress can help us in the short term it helps us deploy immune molecules to protect us against infection and it sharpens our visual focus and our ability to respond to things for survival chronically elevating our stress over long periods of time we know reduces the effectiveness of our immune system and can actually cause certain forms of brain degeneration and while there aren't a lot of longitudinal studies on the heights of kids with ADHD and of course we never can tell how tall someone would have grown to be if they were treated with a drug because we don't have a perfect control experiment even in the case of identical twin experiments and therein there aren't that many of those examples where one twin was treated for ADHD and the other wasn't Etc but here's what we know it does not appear that treatment with sympathomimetics during development provided that dosages are kept in the appropriate ranges is going to limit overall height in fact if you look at the data it appears that children with ADHD who are treated with ADHD meds actually arrive at slightly higher bmis body mass indexes compared to age-matched peers now of course body mass index doesn't necessarily correlate with height right someone could not achieve a full height but could be heavier either through bone or fat or muscle or combination of all three but what we know is that the appropriate use of ADHD meds during development is not stunting development in any kind of overall way it's not preventing maturation of the body in ways that are leading to reduced weight or somehow impaired growth overall with that said long-term elevations of sympathetic nervous system activity does carry some risk and one of the primary risks that people have wondered about is cardiovascular risk this makes perfect sense right when you increase the activity of the sympathetic nervous system you increase blood pressure to increase heart rate you increase in some cases peripheral sweating you know all the things that we associate with stress so you can imagine that a child or adult with ADHD that takes these sympathomimetics every day even if the dosage is kept in a Range that doesn't allow them to experience any immediate untoward side effects so they're not feeling miserable they're just feeling like they can focus better but one always wonders what's going on under the hood so to speak there is as far as I know one major study that's addressed this and the conclusions of that study were a little bit hard to put into a single category it did point to a subtle increase in cardiovascular risk but the results did not point to anything so dramatic that the authors of the study warned against taking these drugs or encouraging people to cease taking these drugs again provided they're being prescribed by a board-certified physician for ADHD and at the appropriate dosage for that person that said I think this all again speaks to the importance of arriving at minimal effective dosage and it stands to reason that if you're somebody who's taking ADHD meds or if your child is taking ADHD meds that one would want to do all the other things that they could do in order to try and improve cardiovascular health or at least not put it at additional risk so those are going to be the obvious things like avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine regular exercise is going to be encouraged and things of that sort and that dovetails into a bunch of other questions that are often asked anytime the topic of Adderall or Ritalin comes up which is what about alcohol you know is drinking alcohol the same time or at different times even going to be problematic if one is taking these drugs is taking benzodiazepines going to be a problem etc etc there's a very straightforward answer to this which is it's very clear that alcohol certainly in children but also in adults is best not consumed I did an entire episode about alcohol which got into this and the data for this if you've heard that having some alcohol in particular red wine is better for you than know alcohol that is simply not true sorry it's not true most adults who are not alcoholics can probably have up to two that's right two drinks per week and still be on the safe side of Health although zero is better than two and once you get past two you start seeing effects on various systems including increased cancer risk especially brain neuron loss and degeneration risk I covered all of those data in the episode on alcohol that you can find at hubermanlab.com combining alcohol with sympathomimetics even though they reside in very different Pathways within the brain in fact the sympathomimetics are driving up sympathetic nervous system activity whereas alcohol is actually doing the opposite it's depressing it and yet all the data points to the fact that combining alcohol with sympathomimetics such as Vyvanse Adderall ritalin or any kind of amphetamine is going to be more detrimental to the brain and body than simply taking those drugs on their own put differently and more directly if you are taking any of the drugs that we've been talking about to treat ADHD or if you just happen to be taking them for whatever reason you are going to want to avoid drinking alcohol at any time and you're going to want to avoid benzodiazepines and similar unless they've been prescribed to you by your physician in advance of this episode I put a call out on social media for questions about Adderall Etc and I got a lot of questions about whether or not their impacts of these drugs on the hormone systems of the body and if they",

libido or anything of that sort in reviewing the literature what I can tell you is that there are very few studies unfortunately of the long-term effects of these drugs on the endocrine or hormone systems of the body but we do know a few things for sure first of all when you increase the activity of the sympathetic nervous system for long periods of time you are very likely increasing levels of cortisol cortisol is a quote unquote stress hormone but cortisol also plays some really important positive roles in your body in fact if you want cortisol released especially early in the day you don't want cortisol released so much late in the day this actually relates back to timing and schedules of taking drugs this is something again that needs to be worked out with your psychiatrist or your child's psychiatrist but one of the reasons why there are so many different drugs for the treatment of ADHD is that each and all of them has a different time course of action so Ritalin is very short-lived which might sound bad because then you have to take it multiple times throughout the day but if you think about from the perspective of sleep and the importance of having low cortisol at night and these drugs increase cortisol and the importance of getting sleep because after all sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance in kids and adults it's responsible for growth it's when neuroplasticity happens it's just so vitally important a lot of the drugs that we've been talking about can severely limit one's ability to fall and stay asleep and so a short-acting drug like Ritalin is actually attractive from the perspective of being able to take it in the morning and still get to sleep at night or taking it in the morning and in the afternoon and maybe even again in the evening depending on the person and then still being able to fall asleep at night whereas long duration release of D amphetamine which is what you get when you take Vyvanse for some people is going to inhibit their sleep they'll get a nice steady rise and Improvement in focus and reduction in hyperactivity but they might have a lot of trouble falling asleep at night and Adderall having a somewhat intermediate time course of action between ritalin which is short-lived and Vyvanse which is very long-lived perhaps is going to be the best solution for somebody else where they can take it early in the day perhaps at a low dose maybe again later in the day low dose and then still fall asleep at night but I've spoken to people and I've spoke to this clinician expert in ADHD who told me that some people will take as little as 2.5 milligrams of Adderall at 6 00 am and have a hard time falling asleep later that night at 11 PM so again vastly different sensitivities to these drugs leading to vastly different requirements of dosage and timing of intake and which particular drug somebody might choose to or choose not to take so how does that relate to hormones and sex and reproduction well cortisol itself is a hormone it can act as a bit of a hormone and a neurotransmitter in the brain but for the most part it's acting as a hormone in the brain and body and it does a number of things first of all it can enhance your levels of focus and alertness it can activate your immune system I know that immunologists out there just cringe when I say activate the immune system your immune system is always doing various things so it's always active just as your nervous system is always active but it can to be specific it can amplify or mobilize the release of anti-inflammatory molecules in your brain and body to combat different types of bacterial viral and fungal infections it's doing an enormous number of positive things it's also involved in setting mood it has interactions with thyroid hormone pathways I've done entire episodes about cortisol and cortisol regulation to paint all of that with a very broad brush and briefly now it's advantageous to have your cortisol release high in the early part of the day and to taper off toward the end of the day in fact late day elevations in cortisol are a strong correlate of depressive symptoms this was demonstrated by my colleagues David Spiegel and Robert sapolsky at Stanford School of Medicine but that is not to say that cortisol is bad it's to say that the timing of cortisol release is key so do these sympathomimetic drugs disrupt the endocrine system well they can if you are very awake and very alert regardless of whether or not you're taking your sympathomimetic treatment for ADHD early in the day or late in the day you are very likely experiencing elevations in cortisol late in the day so it is important even for those of you that like to study and need to focus in the evening and nighttime hours that you try and limit your levels of overall alertness and certainly stress late in the day because doing that day after day after day for several weeks or months or years can indeed disrupt other hormones in the endocrine system and again that's because cortisol is interacting with thyroid hormone and testosterone and estrogen in fact cortisol in many ways competes with or can out-compete for the production of testosterone and other so-called steroid hormones remember cortisol itself is a corticosteroid hormone so when we hear the word steroids oftentimes people just think about athletes and steroid abuse in sports but steroid hormones includes a lot of different types of hormones which are good for us our endogenous steroid hormones are vital for all sorts of things Vitality reproduction Etc and the way this works in general terms is that the cholesterol molecule is used to create testosterone and cortisol and estrogen if we make too much cortisol we in many ways are reducing the total amount of testosterone that we make or that is active it's not exactly that straightforward but we can make that statement with uh with confidence for instance if you spike your cortisol just briefly during the day because you have some sort of stressful event that's not going to inhibit your testosterone in fact it probably is going to boost your testosterone levels somewhat however if your cortisol levels are chronically elevated yes indeed it's likely that you're going to suppress your total and or free Unbound forms of testosterone and downstream to that you will experience effects such as reductions in libido reductions in muscle and bone mass reductions in all sorts of aspects of testosterone related psychology and bodily biology this is true for both males and females and the same thing could be said for estrogen now what's impossible for us to say is whether or not taking a given treatment for ADHD is going to for instance prevent a woman from ovulating that could happen through chronic elevations and cortisol but there's no direct link meaning there are no studies at least that I'm aware of showing that people that take Adderall have irregular ovulatory Cycles or that they cease menstruating entirely I don't think there's any evidence for that whatsoever nor is there any evidence that people that take Adderall or other sympathomimetics for the treatment of ADHD have lower overall testosterone in fact you can imagine all sorts of instances in which the opposite was true that a child or young adult or adult who has ADHD but then goes on these meds to improve their symptoms is now focusing and achieving more in life we know that happiness can impact dopamine and vice versa and testosterone levels and productivity itself and reaching our goals can feedback on the hormone system so anytime there's a discussion about hormones or a study that shows that doing X or not doing why impacts hormone levels of a given type we have to be very careful to make sure that we're talking about causality because all of these hormones are in a very intricate crosstalk with one another we can however make a very general statement which is that when you are in states of stress for long periods of time that is not a favorable condition addition for your immune system your hormone system or frankly any other system in the brain and body so the treatment of ADHD with these drugs should never be done at the expense of these other critical biological systems another common question and concern is whether or not kids and I suppose for that matter adults that take medication for ADHD are basically being predisposed to psychosis and or other forms of addiction and",

treated for ADHD appropriately so with the appropriate dosage of the appropriate drugs under the supervision of a board-certified qualified psychiatrist or at less risk for forming addictions to other substances in adulthood or other substances generally I think a lot of people also wonder whether or not those kids and those adults that take these ADHD meds become addicted to the medications themselves that's a bit of a tricky issue to resolve anytime one stops taking a drug or even tapers off a drug that's used to treat something where they feel better on the drug they're going to experience two sets of effects and these two sets of effects are often confounded with one another one is the withdrawal effects so the effects of removing the drug that makes somebody feel less good than Baseline so for instance a kid that takes ADHD meds until their late teens or early 20s decides they're going to taper off they do that and they're feeling lousy during the taper or when they reduce their dosage to zero they're you know foggy brain they can't focus they feel a little bit depressed mood it unclear whether or not those are withdrawal symptoms or whether or not those are the consequence of not having the systems in their brain activated the way that those systems were activated before I realize that for some of you that might seem like the same thing but that's not necessarily the same thing and probably the best analogy would be something along the lines of a hangover right if somebody drinks too much on a given night the next morning they have a hangover The Hangover makes them feel lousy it's it is actually a withdrawal from alcohol effect but then when they recover from The Hangover they realize that their sober State feels pretty good it doesn't obviously feel the same as being on alcohol but that sober state is not a state of withdrawal okay if we were to look at removal or tapering off of ADHD meds there's going to be a period of withdrawal symptoms but then the real question is how does somebody feel after they get through those withdrawal symptoms so that's an important issue to highlight now in terms of psychosis this is a very interesting and very important literature sure first of all any amphetamine whether or not it's D amphetamine L amphetamine and also methylphenidate for that matter Ritalin can induce psychosis now there are a number of different factors that are going to predispose somebody to psychosis having a first relative who's had psychotic episodes either schizophrenic episodes or bipolar episodes is certainly a strong predisposition of course if an individual themselves have had psychotic episodes that's the strongest predisposition that one could imagine so having a first relative with schizophrenia or with bipolar depression or sometimes called bipolar disorder sometimes it's also just called bipolar these days is going to be a strong predisposition for psychotic episodes made much greater anytime one takes a sympathomimetic drug such as amphetamine but also methylphenidate Ritalin is going to increase that likelihood of psychotic episodes then comes the question of if somebody has a psychotic episode as the consequence of taking any of these drugs whether or not it's been prescribed for ADHD or not will those psychotic symptoms go away after the person stops taking the drug there appears to be a divide in the literature or rather a divide according to drug such that people that take Ritalin methylphenidate and have a psychotic episode often not always but most often if they stop taking methylphenidate The Psychotic episode will cease not always the case but most often times it will cease whereas in individuals who have a predisposition to psychosis or even if they're not aware of a predisposition of psychosis and they take Adderall which as you recall is a combination of D and L amphetamine they can have psychotic episodes that sometimes are very long lasting even after the cessation of the drug and while that might sound kind of shocking and really scary and indeed it is scary it perhaps shouldn't shock us that much because if you recall D amphetamine which there's a lot of in Adderall it's a very potent way of increasing dopamine and anytime you potently increase dopamine in a person who has a predisposition to psychotic episodes you are shifting the whole system toward a greater propensity for psychosis this would also be the appropriate time to talk about meth methamphetamine again methamphetamine is considered an illicit drug a drug of abuse it is responsible for a lot of The Misfortune and tragedy that you see on the streets of major cities and even outside of major cities and rural areas it has all sorts of negative effects on health including oral health cardiovascular health it is neurotoxic to serotonergic neuron so it kills serotonin neurons that is absolutely clear it kills dopaminergic neurons that is absolutely clear one of the ways that methamphetamine creates so many of the problems that it does eating effects on the body abuse potential addictive potential the fact that methamphetamine can spark psychosis in those that have a predisposition to psychosis but also that it can create psychosis in individuals who have no predisposition to psychosis right all of this points to methamphetamine just being a terrible drug all around and yet if you recall back to the beginning of the episode there is one form of prescription methamphetamine but its uses are extremely narrow and it's probably best left out of this conversation because its uses are so so narrow in the clinical sense I managed to talk to One expert this is a board-certified psychiatrist who's expert in ADHD who is also very familiar with the psychosis symptoms induced by methamphetamine and by various ADHD drugs and people who have the predisposition they made it very clear that any of the sympathom and medic ADHD drugs that are of the amphetamine variety so that would be Adderall and extended release Adderall it'll be Pure dexedrine or any variants that include amphetamine are going to have higher likelihood of inducing psychosis and people that have a predisposition of psychosis and yet they did assure me that at appropriately prescribed and safe dosages that the total incidence of psychosis in people that take those drugs is still fairly low and not that much greater than in the general population although there is an increased risk it's not that severe and they also highlighted the fact that methylphenidate Ritalin carries a lower potential for inducing psychosis not zero but a lower level of inducing psychosis then for the amphetamine type sympathomimetics now one exception is a Vyvanse that long release damphetamine that we talked about earlier there does seem to be some things protective about that long duration release of damphetamine that occurs with Vyvanse which is not to say that there's zero abuse or addictive potential with Vyvanse um I was told by the same individual that indeed they've had knowledge of patients trying to increase the rate of absorption of Vyvanse and release of Vyvanse or technically of the damphetamine in order to get more of a high from Vyvanse as opposed to just the extended release but they did assure me however that Vivant seems to be associated with fewer psychotic episodes and less abuse and addictive potential overall which again is not to say that it's a perfectly safe drug but really this just highlights the fact that the kinetics or the time course of dopamine and norepinephrine release that's caused by a given drug is going to correlate very strongly with its abuse potential and addictive potential and its potential to induce psychotic episodes and this is where the discussion about meth becomes especially relevant one of the reasons why meth is so dangerous in terms of its addictive potential and its potential to induce psychotic episodes is first of all how much dopamine it releases again five times more than any of the other drugs that we've been talking about but also how fat past that Peak comes on it's a very fast onset and that's true whether or not people are snorting it without their taking it orally or especially if they inject it intravenously but meth because it increases dopamine so fast into such a great degree and then the the peak in dopamine comes down very fast as well and it drops below the Baseline levels of dopamine that were present initially that's one of the reasons why methamphetamine is so dangerous in terms of addiction and in terms of psychotic episodes this gets back to a bunch of issues we've talked about before on the huberman Lab podcast about dopamine kinetics and I've done two episodes on dopamine that I'll refer you to one is called dopamine motivation and drive which is all about dopamine and regulating dopamine and the other one is about optimizing dopamine it's more of a toolkit focused episode both those you can find at hubermanlab.com but the general takeaway that's relevant for what we're talking about now is that with dopamine it's not just about the absolute levels of dopamine that are reached but how long lasting those increases in dopamine are so with vivance even though vivance is damphetamine it's fairly potent not as impotent as meth but fairly potent at increasing dopamine and norepinephrine it's a long extended release in dopamine and norepinephrine which reduces its overall abuse potential because it doesn't tend to create that immediate Euphoria and high and then crash below Baseline a lot of you will hear that it increases dopamine a lot and then stays up as translating to okay well then you're just euphoric for 16 hours but that's not the case when it comes to dopamine it's an issue of How High that Peak is and whether or not that Peak is stable or whether or not it comes down again and when it comes to psychotic episodes or addictive potential it seems that any drug or behavior that increases dopamine very quickly and then brings dopamine down very quickly is what sets the high potential for addiction and abuse and for inducing psychotic episodes so that's why I'm talking about these two things in parallel and now it should be very clear why vyvance doesn't have so much addictive and abuse potential and has at least lower potential for inducing psychotic episodes and it should also be clear to you that for people who do not have ADHD as",

our modafinil which goes by the brand name Nuvigil the major difference between modafinil and arm modafinil aside from having a slight chemical difference is that modafinil was released first our modafinil is the second in the generation of these drugs and modafinil tends to be very expensive that's one of the reasons why it's prohibitive for some people to take it can be as expensive as 25 a pill or more to more than a thousand dollars per month and our modafinil tends to be far far less expensive I've talked to a couple experts about whether or not there are any genuine differences between these two drugs and they report no although consumers of these drugs for whatever reason whether or not it's Placebo or not report yes there is a different when I say Placebo I in no way mean that these drugs are just acting as Placebo I just mean that you know people tend to get very attached to certain drugs and whether or not the brand name or the generic version works better for them there's all sorts of lore about this in fact there are a lot of people out there who strongly feel that brand name Adderall works better than generic Adderall for them there are a lot of people out there who say the same thing about vivance there are a lot of people out there who say the same thing about Ritalin and all sorts of drugs whether or not that's true or not is unclear it is clear that generic versions of drugs can use binders and other things that are in the pill or capsule that are different than what the brand name pillar capsule uses as binders to hold the drug together and that can impact rates of release and Metabolism Etc but a lot of this is just Laura in fact I went into the literature to try and find any real concrete support for the idea that generic adderall is less potent or less effective than brand name Adderall and despite the tens of thousands of people who will say to the contrary I could not find any peer-reviewed published data about that so who knows maybe it's a belief effect as it's called maybe there's a real difference there nowadays modafinil and armodafinil are prescribed for a huge range of daytime sleepiness issues and we were talking about narcolepsy but there are also people who suffer from daytime sleepiness related to dementia daytime sleepiness related to post surgery anesthesia so there's this thing where people have surgery and then they come out of surgery and they feel better for a few days but then they find that they aren't recovering their normal levels of wakefulness so it's prescribed sometimes to try and get people back into a normal state of wakefulness it's been prescribed for a traumatic head injury after stroke again all of these prescribed uses have to be carried out by a certified physician you really don't want to start cowboying the use of modafinil or modafinil or any other prescription drug for that matter I must say that in discussing all these different drugs during today's episode I have zero knowledge of any of these drugs from a first-hand experience except for our modafinil back in 2017 I was prescribed a very very low dose of armodafinil for jet lag for daytime sleepiness issues really when I was traveling overseas to give a talk so our modafinil was given to me in a 25 milligram tablet it was advised to me that I take a half or even a quarter of that so I started with a quarter I am a believer in minimal effective dose I'm also somebody who's fairly hypersensitive to most medication so I took what I measured out to be five to seven milligrams of our modafinil and what I experienced was pretty profound certainly it relieved any daytime sleepiness in fact it made me feel extremely alert for a period of about four to six hours I can't say it was the most comfortable State although I did not feel as if I had racing heart or anything of that sort I basically felt as if I was in a narrow tunnel of attention for that entire period one thing I did not like about the experience is that it was a very hard experience to come down from there was no crash but I found that that high arousal State didn't taper off for many hours later even though it was most heightened for four hours I would say anywhere from 8 to 12 hours later I still felt like I was you know blinking once every four minutes or so and I've certainly been accused on this this podcast and at other times of blinking to seldom to my knowledge I don't have ADHD I've never been prescribed ADHD meds I've never been tested for ADHD I don't think I have ADHD and yet taking our modafinil certainly increased my levels of attention but at least by that one experience it's not something that I would want to repeat again I certainly would not want to be in that state for learning new material when I sit down to research a podcast or research papers in my lab or forage for information or learn from people or books or lectures or podcasts I want to be in a state of alertness but calm where I can really consider the ideas where I can script things out by hand I'm a big believer in writing things out by hand to remember them later drawing little diagrams I would not want to be in the state that even that very low dose of our modafinil put me in in order to learn and I should mention that both modafinil and armodafinil are associated with a good number of side effects if they don't agree with you or if the dosage is too high things like decreased appetite people get a run nose headache there's this instance of skin rashes in fact one of the reasons why modafinil and arm modafinil aren't more broadly prescribed is that there's a very rare skin condition in which people who have taken certain drugs not just modafin or arm modafinil have developed these very severe burn type blisters and in some cases this can be fatal this is again very rare and it was observed in at least one patient who took modafinil as part of a trial for modafinil as a treatment for ADHD it's called Stevens-Johnson syndrome please if you are squeamish to images of skin abrasions and lesions and things of that sort please don't look it up on the internet unless you're able to handle that and maybe not at all but the point here is that one of the reasons that modafinil in our modafinil are not more widely prescribed for ADHD and that it's still only prescribed off label is that Stephen Johnson syndrome was flagged as kind of a potential risk although the ADHD specialist that I spoke to are somewhat frustrated with that because they insist that the frequency of this syndrome that causes the skin rash that's sometimes fatal is no more frequent in those that took modafinil in this trial than with other drugs that have been approved so this gets into all sorts of issues around what drugs make it to approval and which ones don't and as we know modafinil and or modafinil are already being prescribed in the general population for other things this was dealing specifically with the question of whether or not it should be prescribed in kids with ADHD and certainly I am a proponent of exerting Extreme Caution when thinking about which drugs should be approved for the treatment of anybody but especially kids and to round out our discussion of drugs used for the treatment of ADHD that fall into let's call it the atypical category right the typical category being Adderall Vyvanse methylphenidate and things of that variety the less typical",

an interesting compound it's a compound that was developed to lower blood pressure and indeed it does lower blood pressure and it is an alpha 2A Agonist Alpha 2A being a receptor for norepinephrine so guanfacine is a non-stimulant medication to treat ADHD and it's also used to treat some other conditions as well that is only working on the noradrenergic system it is not tapping into the dopamine system but all the other stuff that we talked about is really ramping up dopamine and norepinephrine guanfacine is only increasing norepinephrine and it's doing so by what we say agonizing or stimulating one particular aspect of the noradrenergic system and that's the alpha 2A system what's interesting about guanfacine is that it has a bunch of Pathways that it activates that feed back onto the autonomic nervous system to dampen down the activation of the sympathetic nervous system so whereas most of what we talked about today are sympathomimetics they tend to make us more ramped up more aroused and alert guanfacine is doing the opposite and as a consequence it's not prescribed that often because a lot of times when people take guanfacine it either has no effect on ADHD symptoms or it tends to make people feel very sleepy however there's a small subset of individuals by about five to ten percent of people that try it including kids that do get some significant relief from their ADHD symptoms and they seem to tolerate guanfacine better than they're tolerating some of the other drugs that we've talked about up until now the way guanfacine works is also really interesting you're now familiar with the locus ceruleus this little packet or we call it a nucleus of neurons in the back of the brain that release norepine different at other sites in the brain and they're going to be those Alpha 2A receptors that guanfacine works on and stimulates lots of different places in the brain related to increasing salience and relevance of particular stimuli that we see and that we need to attend to it appears that guanfacine can activate the prefrontal cortical networks in ways that are above their normal Baseline so that's good so improvements in executive function that Orchestra or teacher-like function we talked about before and can increase the efficacy of that output from Locus ceruleus and what that seems to do is increase the coordinated firing of locus ceruleus neurons with prefrontal cortex so in many ways it's acting like a fine-tuning of that Orchestra conductor operation that is so valuable in teaching these brain circuits during childhood of how to attend to one thing and ignore everything else so this is one reason why guanfacine is now approved not just for adults with ADHD but it's primarily used in kids age 6 to 17 years old for the treatment of ADHD again with the hope that these kids can take the drug and these circuits can learn how to focus and how to attend to certain things and limit impulsivity and hyperactivity and then perhaps come off the drugs although sometimes again people have to stay on them indefinitely the other thing about guanfacine is that because it lowers blood pressure and it has this effect of kind of dampening down overall sympathetic arousal sometimes it is prescribed in conjunction with other ADHD meds so yes there are kids out there and adults out there who are taking Adderall and guanfacine where they're taking Vyvanse and guanfacine and this is where it starts to get into drug cocktails and a bunch of other things that gets everybody a little bit uncomfortable I think because the idea of taking one drug to dampen down the side effects of another drug and to offset things and compensate you know is getting towards what's called poly pharmacology and uh you know I think it's understandable that people be concerned about that and yet again in reviewing this with some of the experts on ADHD there do seem to be a certain category of children out there and adults who really struggle with the standard ADHD meds and in that case guanfacine has provided a certain number of these individuals tremendous relief one note about guanfacine in no way shape or form am I encouraging anyone who's not prescribed guanfacine to take it but should you know someone who's taking guanfacine off label in order to improve their focus or enhance any aspect of their biology or psychology please let them know that it has a profound effect on lowering the tolerance for alcohol such that even small amounts of alcohol can lead to really serious problems and even potentially death so that's a very serious warning with guanfacine so today we discussed a lot of different compounds for the treatment of ADHD and it now should become clear what the general themes of those compounds is the general theme is that they tend to increase overall levels of arousal and wakefulness which leads to decreased",

I explain the brain circuits involved in focus and the key roles dopamine and norepinephrine play in their regulation. Then I explain how stimulants such as Adderall and Vyvanse can increase focus and reduce hyperactivity in kids or adults with ADHD, and how and why Ritalin and other medications (e.g., Modafinil, Guanfacine) may work better for some. I explain the long-term effects of ADHD medications on height, cardiovascular health, hormones, predisposition to addiction and psychosis, and whether these treatments can be used and then stopped. I also discuss the immense individual variation in dosage sensitivity for these medications and the negative side-effects that occur from recreational use.

                "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [upbeat music] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford school of medicine. Today, we are going to talk all about attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. We are also going to talk about normal levels of focus. What are normal levels of focus and how all of us, whether or not we have ADHD or not can improve our ability to focus our ability to rule out distraction. It turns out those are two separate things, as well as remember information better. We are also going to talk about how we can learn to relax while focusing, which turns out to be a critical component of learning new information and for coming up with new creative ideas. So whether or not you have ADHD or know someone who does, or if you're somebody who feels that they do not have ADHD, but would simply like to improve their ability to focus or to be more creative. This episode is definitely for you as well. We are going to talk about drug based tools that are out there. We are going to talk about behavioral tools. We will talk about the role of diet and supplementation, and we will talk about new emerging brain machine interface devices, things like transcranial magnetic stimulation. If you don't know what that is, don't worry, I will explain it to you. These are non-invasive methods for rewiring your brain in order to make focusing more natural for you and to teach you how to increase your depth of focus. Now, just a quick reminder that any time we discuss a psychiatric disorder, it's important that we remember that all of us have the temptation to self-diagnose or to diagnose others. So, as I list off some of the symptomology of ADHD, some of that symptomology might resonate with you. You might think, oh, maybe I have ADHD or you might decide that someone you know, definitely has ADHD. However, it is very important that you don't self-diagnose or diagnose somebody else the clear and real diagnosis of ADHD really should be carried out by a psychiatrist, a physician, or a very well-trained clinical psychologist. There are clear criteria for what constitutes full-blown ADHD. However, many of us have constellations of symptoms that make us somewhat like somebody with ADHD and if you're struggling with focus nowadays, as a lot of people are because of stress, because of smartphone use, which turns out can induce adult ADHD. We'll talk about that. We'll then pay attention to the symptomology. You may actually require professional treatment you might not, equally important is to remember that some of the terms that we cover, like impulse control and attention and concentration are somewhat subjective and they can change over time. Sometimes we have a better level of attention than others. Maybe it depends on how we slept or other events going on in our life where something that we're entirely unaware of. The important thing to remember is that we can all improve our attentional capacity. We can all rewire the circuits that make heightened levels of focus, more accessible to us. We can do that through multiple types of interventions, and we are going to cover all those interventions today. Before we march into the material,",

                "transcript": "So let's talk about ADHD, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Let's also talk about focus and attention and everybody's ability to focus and attend not just people with ADHD. We are also going to talk about tools that would allow anyone, whether or not they have ADHD or not to enhance their level of concentration and focus. Now, ADHD used to be called ADD Attention Deficit Disorder. We have record of ADD in the medical literature dating back to as early as 1904. Now there's nothing special about 1904. That's just the first time that it showed up in the standard medical literature. We have to believe that ADD, which we now call ADHD existed before 1904 and probably long before 1904, why? Well, because it has a strong genetic component. If you have a close relative that has ADHD, there's a much higher probability that you will have ADHD and that probability goes up depending on how closely related to that person you happen to be. So for instance, if you're an identical twin and your twin has ADHD, there's a very high concordance as we say, a very high probability that you will have ADHD up to 75% chance. If you have a fraternal twin with ADHD, that number goes down a bit in the 50 to 60% range and so on. If you have a parent with ADHD, that number ranges anywhere from 10 to 25% likelihood, that you will have ADHD if you have two parents and so on and so on, okay? So there's a genetic component that genetic component it turns out, relates directly to how specific neural circuits in the brain wire up, the chemicals they use and the way they use those chemicals, a topic that we are going to discuss in depth today. Now, if you have a close relative with ADHD, that does not mean that you are faded to have ADHD and if you happen to have ADHD, there are ways to overcome those symptoms of lack of attention, impulsivity and so on. Another important point about ADHD is that it has nothing to do with intelligence, whether or not we're talking about intelligence measured by a standard IQ test a rather controversial issue as many of you probably know, there are lots of forms of intelligence that a standard IQ test just wouldn't pick up emotional intelligence, musical intelligence, spatial intelligence, all sorts of intelligences. None of them are related to ADHD. Being very high functioning doesn't make you more likely to have ADHD and being ADHD doesn't necessarily mean that you have a low IQ. So there are people with ADHD who have low IQs people with ADHD with high IQ, people with ADHD with high emotional IQ or with low IQ in the emotional scale, it's all over the place. The important point is that your ability to attend and focus does not relate to how smart you are or your IQ of any type, not just a standard IQ. The renaming of the ADD to ADHD took place in the mid to late 1980s when the psychiatric community and the psychological community started taking better notice of the fact that so-called hyperactive kids also had attentional issues. This might seem obvious, but there's been extensive and ongoing revision of the criteria for designating a psychiatric disorder and this is still an ongoing process even today. So in the mid eighties, we started hearing about ADHD and then gradually that term ADD has been dropped away. However, just the renaming of ADD to ADHD has led to much better diagnosis and detection of ADHD. So right now the current estimates are that about one in 10 children and probably more have ADHD. The current estimates are anywhere from 10%, one in 10 to as high as 12%. Now, fortunately about half of those will resolve with proper treatment, but the other half typically don't. The other thing that we are seeing a lot nowadays is increased levels of ADHD in adults and there's some question as to whether or not those adults had ADHD that went undetected during their childhood or whether or not ADHD is now cropping up in adulthood due to the way that we are interacting with the world in particular smart phone use, the combination of email, text, real-world interactions, multiple apps and streams of media and social media all coming in at once trying to manage life. All of the things that are going on are creating a kind of cloud of poles on our attention and so there is this question to whether or not we are creating ADHD in adults that never had ADHD prior to being an adult. So let's talk about attention and first let's just define what we mean by attention",

                "desc": "Attention & Focus, Impulse Control",
                "transcript": "and first let's just define what we mean by attention out there in the scientific literature and in discussions about ADHD, we will hear things like attention and focus and concentration and impulse control for sake of today's discussion, attention, focus, and concentration are essentially the same thing, okay? We could split hairs and the scientific literature does split hairs about these. But if we want to understand the biology and we want to have a straightforward conversation about ADHD, if I say attention or focus, I'm basically referring to the same thing, unless I specify otherwise, okay? So people with ADHD have trouble holding their attention. What is attention? Well, attention is perception. It's how we are perceiving the sensory world. So just a little bit of neurobiology 101, we are sensing things all the time. There's information coming into our nervous system all the time. For instance, right now you're hearing sound waves. You are seeing things, you are sensing things against your skin, but you're only paying attention to some of those and the ones that you're paying attention to are your perceptions. So if you hear my voice, you are perceiving my voice. You are not paying attention to your other senses at the moment, okay? You might even be outside in a breeze and until I said that, you might not be perceiving that breeze, but your body was sensing it all along. So attention and focus are more or less the same thing, but impulse control is something separate because impulse control requires pushing out or putting the blinders on to sensory events in our environment. It means lack of perception, impulse control is about limiting our perception. People with ADHD have poor attention and they have high levels of impulsivity they're easily distractable. But the way that shows up is very surprising. You might think that people with ADHD",

                "desc": "Hyper-focus",
                "transcript": "You might think that people with ADHD just simply can't attend anything. They really can't focus, even if they really want to, but that's simply not the case. People with ADHD yes, they are distractable. Yes, they are impulsive. Yes, they are easily annoyed by things happening in the room. They sometimes have a high level of emotionality as well. Not always, but often however people with ADHD can have a hyper focus and incredible ability to focus on things that they really enjoy or and are intrigued by. Now, this is a very important point because typically we think of somebody with ADHD as being really wild and hyperactive, or having no ability whatsoever to sit still and attend and while that phenotype as we call it that contour of behavior and cognition can exist, many people, if not all people with ADHD, if you give them something they really love, like if the child loves video games or if a child loves to draw, or if an adult loves a particular type of movie or a person very much, they will obtain laser-focus without any effort. So that tells us that people with ADHD have the capacity to attend, but they can't engage that attention for things that they don't really, really want to do and as we all know much of life, whether or not you're a child or an adult involves doing a lot of things that we don't want to do, much of our schooling involves doing things that we would prefer not to do and sort of forcing ourselves to do it, to attend, even though we are not super interested in what we are attending to. There are a couple other things that people with ADHD display quite often. One is challenges with time perception.",

                "transcript": "One is challenges with time perception. Now time perception is a fascinating aspect of how our brain works and later we're going to talk about time perception and how you can actually get better at time perception. It's very likely that right now you are doing things that get in the way of optimal time perception and I will tell you how to adjust your ability to measure time with your brain. People with ADHD often run late. They often procrastinate, but what's interesting and surprising is that if they are given a deadline, they actually can perceive time very well and they often can focus very well if the consequences of not completing a task or not attending are severe enough. It's a little bit like the way that people with ADHD can really focus if they like something. Well, if they're scared enough about the consequences of not attending, oftentimes not always, but oftentimes they can attend. If they're not really concerned about a deadline or a consequence, well, then they tend to lose track of time and they tend to underestimate how long things will take. Now many people do that, not just people with ADHD, but people with ADHD have challenges, understanding how to line up the activities of their day in order to meet particular deadlines even if it's just a simple thing, like finishing one set of tasks before lunch, oftentimes they will remember that lunch starts at noon, but somehow they aren't able to fill the intervening time in a way that's productive and they can obsess about the upcoming deadline for instance, we will talk about how to remedy this.

                "desc": "The Pile System",
                "transcript": "In addition, their spatial organization skills are often subpar, not always, but often you will find that somebody with ADHD uses what's called the pile system in order to organize things, they will take many belongings and this could be in the kitchen or in their bedroom or in their office or in any space and they will start piling things up according to a categorization system that makes sense to them and only them. It doesn't really have any logical framework. Now, many people use the pile system and if you use the pile system, that doesn't mean that you have ADHD in fact, if you're unpacking a house or you've moved recently, or you've received a lot of presence recently, the pile system makes perfect sense to organize your space. But people with ADHD tend to organize things according to the pile system all the time and that pile system doesn't work for them. Okay, so that's the key distinction that they use a filing system, and it's not really files, they're piling things up in a way that makes sense to them, but then it doesn't work for them in terms of what tasks they actually need to perform. They can't find things or if anyone moves one thing then it's very disruptive to their overall plan because their overall plan doesn't really work in the first place. So that's a common phenotype as we call it. A phenotype by the way, is just an expression of a particular set of underlying genetic or psychological components, okay? So we say the phenotype. So a phenotype can brown hair and green eyes, like for me, a phenotype could also be that somebody uses the piling system, okay? The other thing that people with ADHD have real trouble with",

                "desc": "Working Memory",
                "transcript": "The other thing that people with ADHD have real trouble with is so-called working memory. Now you might think that people with ADHD would have really poor memories, but in fact, that's not the case. People with ADHD often can have a terrific memory for past events, they can remember upcoming events quite well. Their memory is clearly working. However, one aspect of memory in particular that we call working memory is often disrupted. Working memory is the ability to keep specific information online, to recycle it in your brain over and over again, so that you can use it in the immediate or short term. A good example of this would be you meet somebody, they tell you their name, they give you their phone number verbally, and you have to walk back to your phone and enter it into your phone. People without ADHD might have to put some effort into it, it might feel like a bit of a struggle, but typically they will be able to recite that phone number in their mind over and over, and then put into their phone. People with ADHD, tend to lose the ability or lack the ability to remember things that they just need to keep online for anywhere from 10 seconds to a minute or two, okay? So a string of numbers like 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1 for most people would be pretty easy. 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, you could probably remember that a minute from now without writing it down. But if you add one more number to that 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, 3, it gets tougher, okay? So there's a reason why phone numbers typically have seven digits in them, of course, there's an area code, but remembering information that strings out longer than seven numbers or a sentence or two that's challenging for most people, people with ADHD have severe challenges, even with much smaller batches of information over even much smaller batches of time. Deficits in working memory are also something that we see in people who have frontotemporal dementia, so damage to the frontal lobes or age-related cognitive decline and so it will come as no surprise that later when we discuss treatments, supplements, and other tools for ADHD, that many of those treatments, supplements and tools for ADHD are similar to the ones that work for age-related cognitive decline. Okay, so we've more or less established the kind of menu of items that people with ADHD tend to have some have all of them. Some have just a subset of them. Their severity can range from very intense to mild, but in general, it's challenges with attention and focus, challenges with impulse control, they get annoyed easily. They have kind of an impulsivity, they can't stay on task. Time perception can be off, they use the piling system or a system that doesn't work well for them in order to organize their things in physical space and they have a hard time with anything that's mundane that they're not really interested in. But again, I just want to highlight that people with ADHD are able to obtain heightened levels of focus, even hyper-focus for things that are exciting to them and that they really want to engage in. So now you have the contour of what ADHD is, and if you're somebody who doesn't have ADHD, you should also be asking yourself which aspects of ADHD are similar to things I've experienced before. Because what we know about the healthy brain is that there's also a range of abilities to focus. Some people focus very well on any task. You give them a task, they can just laser in on that task. Other people that have to kind of fight an internal battle, they have to convince themselves that it's important or interesting. They have to kind of incentivize themselves internally. Other people doesn't matter, they could be bored to tears with the information, but they can do it just because they are, \"Very disciplined people.\" We tend to admire those people but as you'll see a little bit later, it's not clear that that's the best way to run your attentional system. There might be something to this business of having heightened levels of attention for the things that you are most interested or excited by. So let's drill into this issue of why people with ADHD actually can focus very intensely on things that they enjoy",

                "transcript": "actually can focus very intensely on things that they enjoy and are curious about. Now, enjoyment and curiosity are psychological terms, they're not even really psychological terms. They're just the way that we describe our human experience of liking things, wanting to know more about them. But from a neuro-biological perspective, they have a very clear identity and signature and that's dopamine. Dopamine is released from neurons, it's what we call a neuromodulator and as a neuromodulator it changes the activity of the circuits in the brain, such that certain circuits are more active than others and in particular, dopamine creates a heightened state of focus. It tends to contract our visual world and it tends to make us pay attention to things that are outside and beyond the confines of our skin. That's what we call exteroception. Dopamine also tends to put us in a state of motivation and wanting things outside the confines of our skin. So whether or not we're pursuing something physical in our world, or whether or not we're pursuing information in our outside world, dopamine is largely responsible for our ability and our drive to do that. But dopamine as a neuromodulator is also involved in changing the way that we perceive the world. So, as I mentioned earlier you have all these senses coming in and you can only perceive some of them because you're only paying attention to some of them. Dopamine when it's released in our brain tends to turn on areas of our brain that narrow our visual focus and our auditory focus, so it creates a cone of auditory attention, that's very narrow, creates a tunnel of visual attention that's very narrow. Whereas when we have less dopamine, we tend to view the entire world, we tend to see the whole scene that we are in, we tend to hear everything all at once. So as I describe this, hopefully you're already starting to see and understand how having dopamine release can allow a person, whether or not they have ADHD or not to direct their attention to particular things in their environment, all right? So now what we're doing is we're moving away from attention as this kind of vague ambiguous term, and we're giving it a neurochemical identity dopamine, and we are giving it a neural circuit identity and just to put a little bit of flavor and detail on which neurocircuits those are,",

                "desc": "Neural Circuits In ADHD: Default Mode Network & Task-Related Networks",
                "transcript": "on which neurocircuits those are, I want to discuss two general types of neurocircuits that dopamine tends to enhance. So let's talk neurocircuits and for those of you that love hearing neuroscience, nomenclature, you're going to eat this part up and for those of you that don't like a lot of names of brain areas I invite you to tune out or just try and grab the top contour of this. I will describe it in pretty general terms, but I will give some detail because I know there are some of you out there who really want to dig deeper into what the exact structures and connectivities are, okay? So there are two main types of circuits that we need to think about with respect to ADHD, attention and dopamine. The first one is called the default mode network. The default mode network is the network of brain areas in your brain and my brain and in everybody's brain that is active when we're not doing anything when we're just sitting there idle at rest. Now it's very hard to not think about anything, but when you're not engaged in any type of specific task, so you're not driving, you're not playing a video game, you're not trying to study, you're not trying to listen, you're just sitting there letting your brain kind of go wherever it wants to go. Your default mode network underlies that state of mind. The other set of circuits that we're going to think about and talk about with respect to ADHD are the task networks, the networks of the brain that make you goal oriented, or that are at least trying to make you goal oriented and those are a completely different set of brain areas. However, the default mode network and these tasks networks are communicating with one another and they're doing that in very interesting ways. So first I want to describe how these two sets of brain areas, the default mode network and the task networks normally interact, okay? So little bit of naming here again feel free to ignore it if you don't want this level of detail, but the default mode network includes an area called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, frontal cortex, no surprises in the front and you have a dorsal, the top and side lateral part dorsolateral, prefrontal cortex. You got one on each side of your brain, right? And then you have a brain area called the posterior cingulate cortex and then you have an area called the lateral parietal lobe. Again, you don't need to remember these names for, these are three brain areas that normally are synchronized in their activity. So when one of these areas is active in a typical person, the other areas would be active as well. So it's a little bit like a symphony or a band like a three-piece band is like drums, guitar, and bass they're playing together, okay? That's how it is in a typical person and in a person with ADHD, or even a person who has subclinical ADHD or in any human being who hasn't slept well, what you find is the default mode network is not synchronized. These brain areas are just not playing well together. Now the task networks include a different set of structures. It still involves the prefrontal cortex, but it's a different part of the prefrontal cortex, okay? Tends to be the medial prefrontal cortex and there are some other brain areas that the medial prefrontal cortex is communicating to all the time, mainly to suppress impulses. It's shutting down the desire to stand up or to scratch the side of your cheek or your nose, if you're trying not to do that, anytime you're restricting your behavior, These task directed networks are very active, okay? Now normally in a person without ADHD, the task networks and the default mode networks are going in kind of Seesaw fashion, they are actually what we call anti-correlated. So it's not just that they are not correlated, they're actually opposing one another they are anti-correlated. In a person with ADHD, the default mode networks and the tasks networks are actually more coordinated. That might come a surprising, I think that we all have this tendency to kind of jump to conclusion and assume that somebody who doesn't have an easy time paying attention or has ADHD, that their brain must be completely incoherent that it's not working well and because everything's out of whack, but there's something interesting about people with ADHD whereby the task networks and the default mode networks are actually working together in a way that's correlated and that is what's abnormal. So this would be like the guitar bass and the drums playing together in a way where the bass isn't keeping the backbeat and the drums, aren't keeping the backbeat that they're playing together, they're all playing the melodies and harmonies in a way that just doesn't sound right. That's what's going on in the brain of somebody with ADHD and we can now confidently say based on brain imaging studies, that when somebody gets better, when they're treated for ADHD or when they age out of ADHD, as sometimes it's the case that the default mode networks and the task networks tend to become anti-correlated again, okay? So that's the underlying neurobiology, but you'll notice that I didn't mention dopamine at all. What dopamine is doing in this context is dopamine is acting like a conductor. Dopamine is saying this circuit should be active then that circuit should be active. It should be default mode network and then when the default mode network is not active, then it should be the task network. So it's really acting as a conductor saying, you go, now you go, now you go, now you go. And in ADHD, there's something about the dopamine system that is not allowing it to conduct these networks and make sure that they stay what, the engineers or physicists or mathematicians would say out of phase to be anti-correlated, okay? Out of phase and anti correlate, essentially the same thing, at least for purposes of this discussion. So that raises two questions, could it be that dopamine is not at sufficiently high levels or could it be that dopamine is just doing it all wrong? In other words, is there no conductor or is the conductor playing with like little tiny toothpicks and so the instruments can't see what they're supposed to do. They can't get the instruction 'cause it's just not loud enough, so to speak, or could it be that the information is getting out, but the information that's getting out is wrong, the conductor's there, but the conductor is in very good at conducting. Now we can gain insight into how the system works and fails and how to treat it",

So what exactly is going on with the dopamine system, in people with ADHD and what's going on with the dopamine system in people that have terrific levels of attention for any task? Well, in the year 2015, an important paper came out. The first author is Spencer, and it came out in a journal called Biological Psychiatry, and it formalized the so-called low dopamine hypothesis of ADHD. The idea that dopamine was somehow involved or not at the appropriate levels in people with ADHD had been around for a pretty long time, but a formal proposition of the low dopamine hypothesis led to some really important experiments and understanding of what goes wrong in ADHD. It turns out that if dopamine levels are too low in particular circuits in the brain, that it leads to unnecessary firing of neurons in the brain that are unrelated to the task that one is trying to do and that is unrelated to the information that one is trying to focus on. So if you think back before you've got this default mode network and a task-related network, and they need to be in this kind of concert of anti-correlation and an ADHD they're firing together. Well, the problem seems to be that when dopamine is low, certain neurons are firing when they shouldn't be, this is like a band, right? We'll go back to our band, that's a guitar bass in it, and the person playing the drums and it's as if one of those or several of those instruments are playing notes when they shouldn't be playing, right? The pauses and music are just as important as the actual playing of notes. When dopamine is too low neurons fire, more than they should in these networks that govern attention. This is the so-called low dopamine hypothesis and if you start looking anecdotally at what people with ADHD have done for decades, not just recently since the low dopamine hypothesis has been proposed, but what they were doing in the 1950s and then the 1940s and the 1960s. What you find is that they tend to use recreational drugs, or they tend to indulge in non drug stimulants. So things like drinking, six cups of coffee or quadruple espressos, or when it was more prominent smoking a half a pack of cigarettes and drinking four cups of coffee a day or if the person had access to it using cocaine as a recreational drug or amphetamine as a recreational drug. All of those substances that I just described in particular cocaine and amphetamine, but also coffee and cigarettes increase levels of multiple neurotransmitters, but all have the quality of increasing levels of dopamine in the brain and in particular, in the regions of the brain that regulate attention and these task related and default mode networks okay? Now young children, fortunately don't have access to those kinds of stimulants most of the time and those stimulants all have high potential for abuse in adults. So we will talk about the potential for abuse in a few minutes. But if you look at children, even very young children with ADHD, they show things like preference for sugary foods, which also act as dopamine inducing stimulants. Now, of course, once they get access to soda pop and coffee and tea, they start to indulge in those more than other people. For a long time,",

                "transcript": "For a long time, it was thought that children with ADHD consumed too many sugary foods or drank too much soda or adults with ADHD would take recreational drugs like methamphetamine or cocaine or would drink coffee to excess or smoke cigarettes to excess because they had poor levels of attention and because they couldn't make good decisions, they were too impulsive and so forth and while that certainly could be the case, knowing what we now know about dopamine, and the fact that having enough dopamine is required in order to coordinate these neural circuits that allow for focus and quality decision-making an equally valid idea is that these children and these adults are actually trying to self-medicate by pursuing these compounds, right? Things like cocaine lead to huge increases in dopamine. Well, what happens was when somebody with ADHD takes that drug, it turns out they actually obtain heightened levels of focus, their ability to focus on things other than things they absolutely care intensely about goes up, likewise, children who consume anything that increases their levels of dopamine, if those children have ADHD, they tend to be calmer, they tend to be able to focus more. Now, this is very different than children who do not have ADHD. When they consume too much sugar, they tend to become super hyperactive. When they consume any kind of stimulant, they tend to go wild and run around like crazy. Actually, I have an anecdote about this just to illustrate it. I have a friend, he has two children that are now in their teens and twenties, but when they were little, one time, I brought them some chocolate just as a gift, when I showed up at their house and within 30 minutes, the kids were running around like crazy I mean they were pretty high energy kids, but they were going bonkers and that's actually when the mother, my friend at the time, unfortunately, still now looked at the chocolate, realized that it was chocolate with espresso beans in it. It was like dark chocolate with espresso beans so I was really at fault there, you don't want to give kids dark chocolate with espresso beans, but what you're really seeing that hyperactivity that is dopamine, okay? It's the sugar combined with the caffeine in this case, combined with a few other compounds that exist in chocolate, that really increase our levels of alertness and our tendency to want to move around a lot, okay? So dopamine and low levels of dopamine apparently are what's wrong in people with ADHD, that dopamine hypothesis is what led to the idea that treating people, children and adults included with dopaminergic compounds would somehow increase their ability to focus and if you look at the major drugs that were developed and now marketed by pharmaceutical companies for the treatment of ADHD, those drugs have names like Ritalin. Nowadays, it's typically things like Adderall, Modafinil and some of the other derivatives, they all serve to increase levels of dopamine in particular dopamine in the networks that control task directed behavior, and that coordinate the default mode network and these task-related networks. So many of you have probably heard of Ritalin. Ritalin is a prescription stimulant that is prescribed for ADHD as well as for narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a condition in which people tend to fall asleep during the day time, quite a lot, excessive daytime sleepiness, not due to lack of sleep at night, but also tend to fall asleep when they get excited, if they're really emotionally excited or about to eat or any other kind of activity that would normally get somebody really aroused and alert people with narcolepsy tend to fall asleep, or they tend to become what's called cataplectic. They tend to just sort of go limp in the muscles. So it's this invasion of sleep into the daytime. It's dysregulated by emotion. You can imagine why a stimulant, something that would wake you up, make you very alert, focused and motivated would be a good treatment for narcolepsy. Adderall also is used to treat ADHD and to treat narcolepsy things like Modafinil also used to treat ADHD and narcolepsy. So you're sensing a theme here. So what are the differences and similarities between these drugs and what can that tell us about ADHD? Well, Ritalin was one of the first-generation drugs that was prescribed for ADHD in order to deal head on with this dopamine hypothesis. This idea that in ADHD, dopamine levels are too low. Nowadays, Adderall is the more typically prescribed drug for ADHD that has to do with some of the so-called pharmacokinetics, the rate at which those drugs enter the system and how long they last in the system. So for instance, Ritalin was a drug that was packaged into various time-release formulas. Whereas initially Adderall was only released in a form that had a very short life, So meaning that it wasn't in the bloodstream very long and didn't affect the brain for very long and so the dosages could be controlled in a more typical way without going into a lot of tangential detail. As you all know, at different times of day, you tend to be more or less alert. So a long sustained release drug while that might sound like a really terrific thing. If that drug is having an effect of making you more alert and it's released across very many hours of your day, there might be periods of your day when you feel too alert, periods of your day, when you feel just right and periods of your day, when you wished that you were more alert. These are some of the pharmacokinetics, kinetics, meaning movement of the different compounds within the bloodstream and brain that could, you could imagine in a very real way, would impact whether or not someone would feel really good on one of these drugs or whether or not they would feel too anxious or too sleepy and so on. Let's take a step back for a second and just ask, what are these drugs? We know they increase dopamine, but what are they really? Well, Ritalin also called methylphenidate is very similar to amphetamine speed, or what's typically call speed in the street drug nomenclature. Adderall, which goes by various other names, okay? So Adderall, Adderall XR, my dialysis, things like that. Adderall is basically a combination of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Now some of you probably realize this, that Adderall is amphetamine, but I'm guessing that there a good number of you out there, perhaps even parents and kids that don't realize that these drugs like cocaine and amphetamine methamphetamine, which are incredibly dangerous and incredibly habit forming and have high potential for abuse. Well, the pharmaceutical versions of those are exactly what are used to treat ADHD and they're not exactly like cocaine or methamphetamine, but they are structurally and chemically very similar and their net effect in the brain and body is essentially the same, which is to increase dopamine primarily, but also to increase levels of a neuromodulator called epinephrin or norepinephrine also called noradrenaline and adrenaline those names are the same and to some extent to increase levels of serotonin in the brain and blood, but not so much serotonin, that's just kind of a small smidgen of effect, okay? So dopamine way up norepinephrine and adrenaline way up. So that's motivation drive, focus and energy and to some extent, a little bit of serotonin, which is really more about feeling calm and relaxed and you can imagine why that would be a good balancing effect for dopamine and norepinephrine. So what I'm essentially saying is that the drugs that are used to treat ADHD are stimulants, and they look very much alike. In fact, nearly identical to some of the so-called street drugs, stimulants that we all here are so terrible. However, I do want to emphasize that at the appropriate dosages and working with a quality psychiatrist or neurologist or family physician does have to be a board certified MD that prescribes these things, many people with ADHD achieve excellent relief with these drugs, not all of them, but many of them do, especially if these treatments are started early in life. So now knowing what these drugs are, I want to raise the question of why prescribe these drugs? I mean, everyone has to make a decision for themselves or for their child as to whether or not they're going to take these things or not. I also want to acknowledge that many people out there, many, many people out there are taking these drugs, even though they have not been clinically diagnosed with ADHD when I say these drugs, I'm specifically referring to Ritalin and Adderall and Modafinil, but more typically it's Adderall, okay? People using cocaine and amphetamine for recreational purposes, that's a completely different beast and it is indeed a beast and it's something that I strongly discourage. However, I'm aware that up to 25% of college students, and perhaps as many as 35% of all individuals between the ages of 17 and 30 are taking Adderall on a regular or semi-regular basis in order to work, in order to study and in order to function and focus in their daily life. Even though they have not been diagnosed with ADHD, there's a whole black market for this. They're getting it from people with prescriptions. I'm not here to pass judgment. I just want to emphasize how these drugs work. Some of the things that they do to enhance cognition and focus that actually serve the brain well in certain individuals and how they can be very detrimental in other individuals. I sort of blew right past it. But the fact that in upwards of 25% of young people are taking things like Adderall,",

A few years ago, it was estimated that Adderall use and Ritalin use without diagnosis of ADHD was second in incident only to cannabis, but actually now the consumption of Adderall without prescription is higher than the consumption of cannabis in that age group. So what that means is that there's a lot of stimulant use in that age group and there are a lot of adults also using and abusing stimulants in order to gain focus. Then we can have a whole discussion about whether or not life is becoming more demanding, whether or not the need for focus is excessive and that's why people are doing that. But frankly, it's an interesting discussion, but it's not one that would deliver us to any answers. Rather, I'd like to focus on the ways that people now and people have always been self-medicating to increase, focus, right? Caffeine, which I can indulge some, I don't think to access has long been used as a stimulant to increase dopamine, increase norepinephrine, increased focus and energy and in addition to that, it works through the so-called cyclic amp, phosphodiesterase pathway, remember anytime you see, you hear an ASE, that's an enzyme. Phosphodiesterase is involved in the conversion of things like cyclic amp into energy for cells and so forth. Basically coffee gives you energy it makes you feel good and it increases focus because of the circuits that it engages in the brain. People have been taking caffeine and continue to take it caffeine for ages. People also used to smoke cigarettes, nicotine in order to gain focus. Nowadays, that's less common because of the concerns, quite valid concerns about lung cancer from smoking, but there's a lot of vaping out there. There are a lot of people now consuming nicotine, which is the active substance in cigarettes and in most nicotine vapes that stimulates the brain to be more focused and more alert. So the idea of taking stimulants of consuming things or smoking things in order to increase alertness is not a new idea. It's just that in ADHD,",

                "transcript": "It's just that in ADHD, it's surprising that these things would work, right? I mean, if the problem is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, what we're really talking about here, or children that are prescribed a drug that ought to be a stimulant, it ought to make them hyper hyperactive and rather than doing that, it actually somehow serves to calm them a bit, or at least allow them to focus. Here's the reason, children have a brain that's a very plastic meaning it can remodel itself and change in response to experience very, very quickly compared to adults. Taking stimulants as a child, if you are a child diagnosed with ADHD allows that forebrain task related network to come online, to be active at the appropriate times and because those children are young, it allows those children to learn what focus is and to sort of follow or enter that tunnel of focus. Now, by taking a drug, it's creating focus artificially, it's not creating focus because they're super interested in something it's chemically inducing, a state of focus, and let's face it a lot of childhood and school and becoming a functional adult is about learning how to focus even though you don't want to do something. In fact, when I was in college, I had this little trick that may or may not work for some of you, which is if I couldn't focus on the material I was trying to learn, I would delude myself into thinking that it was the most interesting thing in the world. I would just kind of lie to myself and tell myself, okay, this, I won't mention the subjects, I absolutely love this. I would just, I would tell myself that I loved it and I noticed that just that selective or deliberate engagement of that desire to know circuit, whatever that is in my brain, no doubt involves dopamine, allowed me to focus and remember the information and somewhat surprisingly or perhaps not surprisingly, I would often fall in love with the information. I find that that was my favorite class. So it was what I wanted to learn the most. So that's one way you can do it artificially, but kids with ADHD, they can't do that, right? They're told to sit still and they end up getting up 11 times. They are told that they can't speak out in class or that they have to remain in their seats for 10 minutes and they just, despite their best effort, they simply cannot do it, they're highly distractable. So what are we to make of this whole picture that we need more dopamine, but these kids with ADHD, they're getting their dopamine by way of a drug, which is for all the world amphetamines, right? It's speed, that's really what it is. What are the long-term consequences, where the short-term consequences and what should we make of people taking these drugs without a clinical need? What are the consequences there? Well, in order to get to some of those answers,",

                "transcript": "Well, in order to get to some of those answers, I went to one of my colleagues, this is a colleague that I've actually known for a very long time, I was their teaching assistant when they were an undergraduate, they went on to get an MD, a medical degree, as well as a PhD and become a pediatric neurologist that specializes in the treatment of epilepsy and ADHD in kids of all ages, from age three to 21, that's the age range, pretty broad age range and has extensive knowledge in this and what makes them particularly interesting for sake of this discussion is that they have a child, a young boy, who's now showing signs of ADHD and they are on the threshold of trying to decide whether or not they will prescribe Adderall or something similar. So we had a discussion about this and prior to learning that their child may have ADHD. I asked the following questions. First of all, I asked, what do you think about giving young kids amphetamine? And their answer was, on the face of it, it seems crazy, but provided that the lowest possible dose is used and that that dosage is modulating as they grow older and develop those powers of attention, their observation was that they've seen more kids benefit than not benefit from that. Now I'm certainly not saying what people should do. You obviously have to go to a doctor because as I always say, I'm not a doctor, I don't prescribe anything, I'm a professor so I profess things and here I'm professing that you talk to your doctor, if you're considering giving Ritalin or Adderall or any type of stimulant to your child, of course, what could be more important than the health of your child. But it was a very interesting answer because typically we hear yes, medicator don't medicate. Rarely do we hear that the medication should be adjusted across the lifespan and in any particular kind of way. Now the fact that this person, this now friend of mine and colleague of mine has so much expertise in the way that the brain works and is considering putting their child on such medication. I said, why wouldn't you wait until your kid reaches puberty? I mean, we know that in boys and in girls, there are increases in testosterone and estrogen during puberty, that dramatically change the way that the body appears. But also that dramatically change the way that the brain functions in particular we know this, that puberty triggers the activation of so-called frontotemporal task related executive functioning. That's just fancy science speak for being able to focus, being able to direct your attention, being able to control your impulses, look at a small child, or look at a puppy and then look at an older child, or look at a dog, very different levels, patterns of spontaneous behavior. Young children move around a lot they're, I don't want to say shifty, cause that makes it sound like they're up to something bad, which they might be, but they don't have to be up to something bad, they fidget a lot. So to puppies, everything's a stimulus as animals and humans get older, they learn how to control their behavior and sit, still, listen and focus even if they don't want to. So giving a drug that allows a child to access that stillness early on it's thought will allow them to maintain that ability as time goes on. But I decided to push a little bit further, I said, well, why would you do it now as opposed to during puberty or after puberty? And their answer was very specific and I think very important, what they said was look, neuroplasticity is greatest in childhood and tapers off after about age 25, but neuroplasticity from age three until age 12 or 13 is exceedingly high and they're right, when you sit back and you look at the literature on neuroplasticity, you'd say childhood plasticity and young adult plasticity is much greater than adult plasticity, but that early childhood plasticity is far and away the period in which you can reshape the brain at an accelerated rate. So this lines up really well with the clinical literature. Not surprisingly, there are clinician that early treatment is key. If you have the opportunity to work with a quality physician and treat these things early, these drugs can allow these frontal circuits, these task-related circuits to achieve their appropriate levels of functioning and for kids to learn how to focus in a variety of different contexts. Now, is that the only thing that they should be doing? Of course not. So the next question I asked was",

                "desc": "Elimination Diets & Allergies In ADHD",
                "transcript": "So the next question I asked was what should we make of all this diet related stuff, right? I've heard before that the so-called elimination diet or ingesting no sugars or no dairy or no gluten, that all of these things have been purported to improve symptoms of ADHD and people and parents with ADHD go to fanatic lanes to try and find the exact foods that are causing problems and the exact foods that the kids can eat in order to try and get their brain wired up right, and correctly, and to avoid lifelong ADHD and their answer was really interesting. But before I tell you their answer, I want to tell you the studies and the data related to this question of whether or not food and the constellation of foods that one avoids and will eat has anything to do with our levels of attention and in particular, whether or not that can be used as a leverage point to treat ADHD. So you can imagine the challenges of exploring the role of diet and nutrition in any study, but especially in a study on ADHD, why? Well, because as I mentioned before, children with ADHD, and it turns out adults with ADHD tend to pursue sugary foods or any types of food that increase their levels of dopamine. They are naturally drawn to those foods, whether or not they realize it or not, presumably as a way to try and treat their lack of focus and impulsivity. So in this study that I'm about to share with you, there was no drug treatment, it was just a study, manipulating diet and involved 100 children, 50 in the so-called elimination diet group, the special diet where certain foods were eliminated and 50 in the so-called control group. However, being a well-designed randomized controlled trial, this study also included a crossover, meaning where the kids would serve as their own control or control group at a certain portion of the study. So there'll be in one group where they eliminated certain foods and then after a period of time in the study, they would swap to the other group. This is a powerful way to design a study for reasons that you can imagine, because you start to eliminate changes and effects due to individual differences. In any case, 100 children total 50 in each group at any one period in time and the effects that they observed were extremely dramatic. In the world of statistics and analysis of scientific data, we talk about P-values, probability values. What's the likelihood that something could happen according to chance and typically the cutoff would be something like P less than 0.05, that's less than 0.05 chance essentially, of the effect being due to chance. However, in this study, every single one of the effects is P less than 0.0001, very, very infant decimally small probability that the effect observed could be due to chance. So what were these effects? These effects were enhanced ability to focus, less impulsivity, even less tendency to move when trying to sit still. So everything from mental focus to the ability to control their bodies improved when they were in the elimination diet group, what was eliminated? Well, the elimination diet in this particular study was a so-called oligoantigenic diet. It was a diet in which each kid took a test to determine which foods they had antibodies for, meaning that they were mildly allergic to. Now in this study, it was very important that the kids not be extremely allergic to any food because as I mentioned before, they actually served as a control at one point in the study where they were eating all sorts of foods, including foods that had mild allergies to. So basically what the study said was that eliminating foods to which children have allergies can dramatically improve their symptoms of ADHD. And this study, not surprisingly because it was published in such a high quality journal Lancet, et cetera, large number of subjects set the world on fire. People were extremely excited about these results because here in the absence of any drug treatment, there was a significant improvement in ADHD symptoms observed and then came the criticisms. So many papers were published after this specifically dealing with re-analysis of these data and I want to be fair in saying that the data in the paper look good, but there are criticisms of the overall structural design of the study. I don't want to go into all the details exactly 'cause it gets really nuanced about some of the statistics and the way that one examines these types of data, but there was skepticism and in science, skepticism is healthy, especially when making decisions about whether or not to treat or feed children one food or another, or give them one drug or another. Now I want to return to the story of my friend, who is a pediatric neurologist and treats ADHD and has a child who is on the precipice of perhaps starting to take drugs for the treatment of ADHD. I asked the simple question, do you see an effect of diet? Meaning when parents control the diet of their children, does it make a positive or negative or no difference in terms of the way that the kids respond to ADHD, drugs like Ritalin and Adderall or whether or not it can help them avoid treating with those drugs entirely? And her response was very straightforward, she said, elimination of simple sugars has a dramatic and positive effect. She's observed that over and over and over again in many dozens, if not hundreds of patients, okay? Now that's not a peer reviewed study, that's a statement that I'm conveying to you anecdotally, but it's a highly, highly informed one. I said, what about these elimination diets? She said, and I found other sources to support this, that these oligoantigenic diets are controversial. There are many people who really believe in identifying all the things that you're allergic to and making sure that you and especially your kids avoid those foods. However, there's another camp that's starting to emerge in the peer reviewed scientific literature, showing that when kids are not exposed to certain foods in particular nuts and things of that sort, they develop allergies to those foods and then when exposed to them later, they cause real problems. So there's a whole galaxy of discussion and controversy and outright fighting about allergies and kids and whether or not the oligoantigenic diet is the appropriate one. However, out of the four neurologists and psychiatrists that I spoke to about ADHD in preparation for this, every single one said children with ADHD, as much as possible, should be encouraged to avoid high sugar and simple sugar foods of most kinds and if they can find particular foods that exacerbate their symptoms, obviously eliminating those foods is beneficial and the foods that exacerbate their symptoms change over time. So I don't like giving a complicated answer, but I also don't like giving an incomplete answer. What this tells me is that children, especially young children who have ADHD should probably not eat much sugar in particular simple sugars. In addition to that, exploring whether or not they have existing allergies to foods, they already consume might be a good idea. At least that's what this paper, the Pelsser et. al Lancet paper seems to speak to and I should mention that that paper was published in 2011. Since then there have been many dozens of studies exploring the same thing, as well as meta analysis of all those data and it does appear that diet can have a highly significant role in eliminating or at least reducing the symptoms of ADHD so much so that some of the children are able to not take medication at all, or eventually wean themselves off medication as young adults and as adults. One interesting question is whether or not adults should modify their diet in order to increase their levels of focus, if they're already having normal levels of focus, but we'd like more or would like to reduce existing adult ADHD, that's an interesting, and even more controversial topic, it brings us right into the realm of what are called",

I've talked many times on this podcast about the known benefits of omega-3 fatty acids in particular, getting a one gram 1000 milligrams or more even as much as 2000 milligrams each day of the so-called EPA component of omega-3 fatty acids known to have antidepressant effects, mood elevating effects, known to have important effects protecting the cardiovascular system. I think it's now clear that the immune system also benefits that omega-3 fatty acids that include a gram or more of EPA that are very beneficial typically that's done through fish oil, liquid fish oil is going to be the most cost efficient, but they're capsule forms for those of you that don't like fish oil, you can ingest this through other means you can get it from certain algaes or krill, et cetera. You have to make it compatible with your particular diet, whether or not you're vegan or vegetarian or omnivore, et cetera. Omega-3s have shown, been shown to have all these positive health benefits. Do they have positive effects on focus and attention? And the answer is you can find studies that support that statement and the effects are significant, but the effects are modest. You can also find studies that show no effect, however much like with omega-3s and antidepressants, whereby ingestion of omega-3 fatty acids of a gram or more of EPA per day allows people with major depression to get away with taking lower doses of antidepressant medication. It does seem that ingestion of omega-3 fatty acids in adults that include EPA is of 1000 milligrams or more can allow adults with ADHD or mild attention deficit issues to function well on lower doses of medication and in rare cases to eliminate medication entirely. So what this says is once again, that the omega-3 fatty acids are beneficial, will they cure or eliminate ADHD? I think it's safe to say, no, they are playing a supportive or what we call a modulatory role. Just like good sleep,",

                "transcript": "Just like good sleep, plays a supportive and modulatory role for essentially everything, your immune system, your ability to think your ability to regulate your emotion, it's modulating that process. This component of modulation is extremely important to highlight and I think I want to spend a moment on it because this is especially important in the context of ADHD and all the information that's out there. There are biological processes that are mediated by particular compounds like dopamine. So for instance, the ability to feel motivated, to attend to focus is mediated by the circuits in the brain that release dopamine. However, attention is also modulating by how rested you are. If you want to eliminate your ability to think well at all, just stay up for two nights and don't sleep at all right? If you do that, you will have modulating the circuits in your brain that respond to various things and you will be highly distractible. You'll be highly emotional. You will feel like garbage, but that doesn't mean that sleep mediates, focus and attention. It modulates it indirectly. Likewise, I think these omega-3 fatty acids in particular the EPA is which are so beneficial for mood and apparently also for attention, they directly mediate attention and mood, what they do is they modulate those circuits, they make dopamine more available. They make whatever dopamine is available, more likely to bind to the various receptors that are present on neurons and so forth and I think this is very important because likewise diet in any discussion about nutrition has to include this framework of is the diet, the elimination diet, or whether or not it's some other diet or esoteric diet, ketogenic diet, is it modulating or mediating a process? And most likely in the context of ADHD, it's modulating that process. So if the ADHD is mild or if it's caught early enough, or if it's in conjunction with pharmacology with a prescription treatment, well, then it might help guide the child or adult to a better place of being able to focus. But it's not going to be the switch that flips everything. Now that does not mean that consuming the wrong foods, sugary foods or foods that you happen to be allergic to is a good idea it will still be detrimental. So I hope that conceptual framework helps because if you go online, if you're somebody with ADHD or not your going to be bombarded with the ADHD diet, the oligoantigenic diet, the elimination this, this supplement that EPA and I think it's very important to understand whether or not you're talking about something mediating a process or modulating a process. Now drugs like Ritalin, drugs like Adderall, they are tapping into the circuitries and the neurochemistries that mediate attention and focus. They are not the only alternatives or the only choices rather for treatment of these circuits and enhancement of the circuits for focus. I'm going to talk about other alternatives and some behavioral alternatives that are not very well known, but are very, very effective in a few minutes. But I really want to make this clear distinction between modulation and mediation, because it's vital for anyone that's trying to modulate or mediate anything within their own brain. If any of you are interested in this oligoantigenic diet, as it relates to ADHD, and you want to explore a more recent study besides that classic 2011 Lancet study, that's rather controversial. There's a paper that was published in frontiers in psychiatry just last year, 2020. The title of the paper is, \"Oligoantigenic diet improves children's ADHD rating scale scores reliably in added video rating.\" The added video rating is just that they're using an additional measure of focus and attention. Again, that's Frontiers in psychiatry, 2020, I'll put a link to it in the caption, and that's a more recent study for you to peruse. So we've talked about the neural circuits of focus",

                "transcript": "So we've talked about the neural circuits of focus and the chemistry of focus, but we haven't talked yet about what would make us better at focusing and what focusing better really is. So let's take a step back and think about how we focus and how to get better at focus and I'm going to share with you a tool for which there are terrific research data that will allow you in a single session to enhance your ability to focus in theory forever. What am I about to read you is from an excellent book that I recommend, if any of you are interested in neuroscience and things like meditation and default mode networks and things of that sort, the book is called, \"Altered Traits.\" Science reveals how meditation changes your mind, brain and body and no, I'm not going to try and convince you to meditate. I'm going to share with you a small passage in the book that relates some research data related to focus that are very important. If you want to meditate, that's your choice. That's a separate matter. This is a book by Daniel Goleman and Richard Davidson and I should just mention that Goleman is a well-known author has written books on emotional intelligence and so forth. Richard Davidson is also a PhD. He's a professor of psychology and psychiatry, and he's at a University of Wisconsin Madison, he's done terrific work on brain states and modulation of brain states and so forth. What we're about to talk about is when attention works and when attention falters and what we are specifically going to talk about are what are called attentional blinks, not actual eye blinks. We're going to talk about that in a few minutes, but we're going to talk about attentional blinks. I'm paraphrasing here because Goleman and Davidson wrote about this so beautifully. I'd rather paraphrase from them than try and just make up a new way to say it that is less interesting or less good, but I want to credit them. Attentional blinks are really easy to understand, if you think about a where's Waldo task, you know this task where's Waldo where, there are a bunch of people and objects and things in a picture and somewhere in there is Waldo with the striped hat and the glasses and go skinny dude, and you have to find Waldo and so it's a visual search and it's visual search for an object that has distinct features, but is embedded in this ocean of other things that could easily be confused as Waldo. So you tend to look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, and then you find Waldo. Kids can do this they enjoy doing this. Adults may or may not enjoy it, but they can do it too. They find Waldo, when you find Waldo or when you search for a target in some other visual search task at that moment, your nervous system celebrates a little bit and it celebrates through the release of neurochemicals that make you feel good, you found it and you pause. Now, the pause is interesting because when you pause, what we know from many experiments is that in that moment of pause and mild celebration, however, mild you are not able to see another Waldo sitting right next to it. So what this means is in attending to something in searching and in identifying a visual target your attention blinked it shut off for a second and there's a more formal and more laboratory type way that we look at this. The more typical way to do this is to give someone a string of letters or a string of numbers and beforehand you tell them be on the lookout for the letters R and Z, okay? You're just going to watch this string of numbers go by and there will be a letter R in there, and there will be a letter Z in there and try and spot them both and what you find is when you present that string of numbers, and then they see the R, they see the R they register it consciously and they tend to miss the Z, just like in the Waldo type example. Now, of course the numbers are going by pretty quickly, but they can spot the R. They could also spot the Z, if you told them beforehand, just spot the Z and the numbers are moving through at the same rate in both conditions. So what that means is that in every case, you are capable of seeing the R or the Z it's when you try and see both that seeing the first one prevents you from seeing the second one, it's what we call an attentional blink. We do this all the time and people with ADHD tend to have many more attentional blinks than people that don't and this is true for children and for adults. This is an important point. So important that I want to emphasize it twice in case you attentionally blinked. If you see something that you're looking for, or you're very interested in something, you are definitely missing other information in part because you're over focusing on something and this leads to a very interesting hypothesis about what might go wrong in ADHD, where we've always thought that they cannot focus and yet we know they can focus on things they care very much about, well, maybe just maybe they are experiencing more attentional blinks than people who do not have ADHD and indeed, there are data now to support the possibility that that's actually what's happening and that should be exciting to anyone that has ADHD. It should also be exciting to anyone that cares about increasing their focus and their ability to attend. What this is saying is that these circuits, that underlie focus in our ability to attend and our ability to eliminate distraction, they aren't just failing to focus. That's just a semantic way of describing the outcome. They are over focusing on certain things and thereby missing other things. And so our distractability or the distractability of somebody with ADHD could exist because they are over focusing on certain elements and there are there for missing other elements that they should be attending to. So what they really need is this property that we call open monitoring.",

                "transcript": "that we call open monitoring. Now open monitoring is something that's described in the book that I just referred to and that typically is associated with people who have done a lot of meditation, so called Vipassana meditation, or have spent a lot of time learning how to do what's called open gaze visual analysis and open gaze thinking. But there's a simpler version of this that allows us to bypass all that. First of all, your visual system has two modes of processing. It can be highly focused, a soda straw view. So looking for the R in this string of numbers in the example that I just gave, or if you're very excited about something you're in that soda straw view of the world, and you're missing other things, okay, that's high levels of attention. However, there's also a property of your visual system that allows you to dilate your gaze, to be in so-called panoramic vision. Panoramic vision is something you can do right now, no matter where you are, and I can do it right now, you won't know that I'm doing it, but even though I'm still looking directly at you, I'm consciously dilating my gaze so that I can see the ceiling, the floor and the walls all around me. That panoramic vision is actually mediated by a separate stream or set of neural circuits going from the eye into the brain and it's a stream or set of circuits that isn't just wide angle view. It also is better at processing things in time. Its frame rate is higher. So you've seen slow motion video, and you've seen standard video, slow motion video gives you that slow motion look, because it's a higher frame rate. You're thin slicing time, okay? You can use panoramic vision to access the state that we call open monitoring. When people do that, they are able to attend to and recognize multiple targets within this string of numbers. They can see the R and they can see the Z and they can see additional things. So this is something that can be trained up and people can practice whether or not they have ADHD or not. What involves is learning how to dilate your gaze consciously, that's actually quite easy for most people, whether or not you wear corrective lenses or contacts or not you can consciously go into open gaze and then you can contract your field of view as well. There have also been studies done where people were taught to think in a particular way for a very short period of time, and that forever changed their ability to limit or reduce the number of these attentional blinks. There are now published accounts in the literature of a simple practice done for about 15 minutes, where subjects were asked to just sit quietly eyes closed and do what is sort of akin to meditation, but to not direct their mind into any particular state or place, but simply to think about their breathing and to focus on their so-called interoception, focus on how their body feels, their mind drifted to bring it back, okay? So it's basically meditation for about 15 minutes. That might not seem like a significant or unusual practice or that it would have any impact at all. But remarkably, just doing that once for 17 minutes, significantly reduced the number of attentional blinks that people would carry out. In other words, their focus got better in a near permanent way without any additional training. There's something about that practice of reducing the amount of visual information coming in and learning to pay attention to one's internal state, what we call interoception that allow them an awareness, such that when they needed to look for visual targets, when they need to focus on multiple things in sequence, they didn't experience the same number of attentional blinks and I should mention not incidentally as people age and their working memory gets worse and their ability to focus gets worse, the number of attentional blinks that they carry out goes up, and there are now studies exploring whether or not the simple meditation like practice of 15 to 20 minutes or so of sitting and just quietly resting and paying attention to one's breathing and internal state can also offset some of that age-related what is called cognitive decline. So what these data tell me is that regardless of whether or not you're a child or you're an adult, whether or not you have ADHD or not, whether or not you're experiencing age-related cognitive decline, or you would simply like to avoid age-related cognitive decline, a simple practice of taking 17 minutes sitting and paying attention to your internal state, just interocepting, registering your breathing, registering the contact of your skin with whatever surface you're on, can forever rewire your brain to be able to attend better and possibly even offset some of that age related attentional drift. Now, I don't expect anyone to start meditating regularly. I don't expect anyone to do anything they don't want to do, but I think most of us could handle one meditation's session of 17 minutes or so and so if ever there was a tool that stood to rewire our attentional circuitry in a powerful way. This seems to be it and in addition, the ability to engage in panoramic vision, to dilate our gaze, the so-called open monitoring that allows the brain to function in a way that it can detect more information faster, that's a powerful tool as well and the beauty of that tool is that it works the first time and it works every time. Now, how exactly it works is a little bit unclear. Is it for instance, orchestrating this synchrony or asynchrony between the default mode network and the task related networks we don't know. Those studies have not yet been carried out. Nonetheless, the effects are significant, they are long lasting and they appear to exist after just one session of this quiet 17 minute interoception, which to me makes it seem like a very worthwhile thing to do for everybody. So we just talked about attentional blinks,",

                "transcript": "So we just talked about attentional blinks, which are essentially blinks of thinking it's your mind shutting off for a moment and missing information. Now let's talk about actual blinks, the sort that you do with your eyelids. Now, this might come across as somewhat obvious, but you can do fast, what are called spontaneous blinks and they're always coordinated between the two eyes or you can do long blinks like when you go to sleep at night, you do one very long blink, and I'm not being facetious. When you go to sleep at night, you are shutting your eyelids and you are limiting the amount of information coming in and your perception of time starts to drift as you go into sleep. Your perception of time changes from very fast, at one moment to very slow meaning the frame rate at which you are analyzing information dreaming, et cetera, is variable when you were in sleep, sometimes it's very fast. Meaning you experienced things in slow motion. Sometimes it's very fast. In waking to your experience of time can sometimes be very fast sometimes be very slow. Typically the more alert you are, the higher the frame rate, your thin slicing your experience. You've probably had this happen. If you're ever very stressed and you're waiting for something or somebody, it seems like it takes forever because your frame rate is higher you're analyzing time more finely. Conversely, if you are very relaxed or even sleepy, you wake up and you have to think of all the things you have to do. It will seem like the world is going by very, very fast and that you are moving very slow. Time is going at the same rate, but your perception of time is what's changed. Believe it or not. Your perception of time is also changed on a rapid basis. Moment to moment basis by how often you blink. This is a well-established literature in the world of neuroscience that unlike the literature and claims about blinking and sociopathy, which have no basis, the science of blinking as it relates to time perception has some very good data to support it. I want to just emphasize one study in particular, which is quite appropriately titled, \"Time dilates after spontaneous blinking.\" This is a paper that was published in current biology. The first author is Terhune, T-E-R-H-U-N-E. It's a wonderful paper. They examine the relationship between fluctuations in timing and blinking and to make a long story short what they found is that right after blinks, we reset our perception of time, okay? So blinks in that sense are a little bit like the curtain coming down on a scene between scenes in a play or takes in a movie, and they clap the clap thing, they started take in our, what do they say, action and then at the end they do the thing and they click it down and they say, it's a take that's one take when you blink it's a take, okay? Now what's interesting and will immediately make sense to you as to why this is important is that the rate of blinking is controlled by dopamine. So what this means is that dopamine is controlling attention. Blinks relate to attention and focus, and therefore the dopamine and blinking system is one way that you constantly modulate and update your perception of time and fortunately, it's also one that you can control. So the basic takeaway of this study was that blinking controls time perception, but also that levels of dopamine can alter your sense of time and stay with me here, and that blinking and dopamine are inextricably linked. They are working together to control your attention. When dopamine levels go up, people tend to overestimate how long something lasted, why? Because they are processing time more finely it's slow motion mode. When dopamine levels are lower, they tend to underestimate time intervals. Let's remember back to the very beginning of the episode, what's going on in people with ADHD, they are not good at managing their time, they tend to run late, or they are disorganized. They are not just disorganized in space, meaning in that physical space, around them, they're disorganized in time. Their dopamine is low, we know that as well and so they are underestimating time intervals and so it makes perfect sense that they would be late. It makes perfect sense that they would lose track of time or the ability to focus. This is really exciting because what it means is that children with ADHD, adults, with ADHD or people with normal levels of focus that want to improve their ability to focus can do so through a training that involves learning how often to blink and when, and how to keep their visual focus on a given target and it turns out this study has actually been done. There's a study again, I'll link to the study, entitled \"Improvement of attention in elementary school students through fixation focused training activity.\" I won't go through all the details, but what they found was a short period of focusing on a visual target, allowed the school children to greatly enhance their ability to focus on other types of information and a significant component of the effect was due to the way that they were controlling the shutters on their eyes, their eyelids, and controlling their blinks. So what they did in this study is they had these kids focus their visual attention on some object that was relatively close, like their hand for a minute or so, which actually takes some effort if you try and do that, they were allowed to blink. However, it's known from other work that if people can consciously override the desire to blink, at least to the point where they feel like they have to, or else their eyes were dry out, that actually can increase attention even further and they had conditions where they would look at a point further across the room and even further across the room. It only took a few minutes each day to do this 30 seconds in one condition, or maybe a minute and then at another station of looking a little bit further out and a little bit further out, however, there was an important feature of this study that is definitely worth mentioning, which is before they did this visual focus, task or training, they did a series of physical movements with the kids so that the kids could sort of eliminate or move out some of their desire to move and would thereby enhance their ability to sit still. Now it's long been known that kids need a recess, they need time to run around and play and roll around, do whatever it is that they do in order to be able to sit still at all. Adults probably need this too, frankly, but kids need it more because the circuits in the brain that control reflexive movements and as we say, kind of rhythmic undulating behavior and things like that, that's an active suppression and kids have less of that circuitry built up until they hit about age 15 or 16. So they had the kids move around a bit and then do this focus training. That brings me to another treatment that's actively used nowadays in schools for kids with ADHD,",

So what you will find is that some kids with ADHD are now given a rubber band on their desk, literally a rubber band that's attached to their desk and they're able to pull on it, even snap it against the desk, if I had done that when I was a kid, I think my teachers were throw me out of class, but I think it's great that they're allowing them to do this now as a way of moving some of their physical energy out or engage their physical energy, rather, as opposed to trying to sit statue still all the time and attend and it turns out that does enhance these children's ability to focus mentally when they have some physical activity to attend to and it turns out it also can work for adults. I'll share with you I related anecdote because it illustrates the underlying mechanism. I've had the great privilege of being able to do a number of surgeries, brain surgeries during my career. So one thing you find when you do brain surgeries, is that the brain's pretty small regardless of the species that you're working on and you're in there and you're trying to do something very specific and the more you try and hold your hands really steady, the more they want to shake, all right? So it's not natural for any of our limbs to sit perfectly still, depending on how much coffee you had, how well rested you are and your sort of baseline level of autonomic arousal. Some of you may find that you can hold out your hand, absolutely rock solid, others will shake a little bit more. It doesn't mean you're if you're shaking, doesn't mean you're calm if you're still. What it relates to is the amount of what we call premotor activity, the number of commands to move that are being sent through the system and that's what I mean by reverberatory activity and it does seem that kids with ADHD and adults with ADHD have a lot of reverberatory activity in their nervous system and so that's that constant desire to move it's hard for them to sit still and therefore it's hard for them to attend, to harness their attention. When you do a surgery and you find that your hands are shaking, what you learn from your mentors, which I did and what works extremely well, whether or not you're doing a surgery or not, is that you simply tap your foot or you bounce your knee a little bit, which you might think would make your hand shake even more, but provided that it's subtle. What it does is it actually shuttle some of the activity from those premotor circuits to elsewhere in the body and then you're able to sit much more still with your hand, you're able to perform the surgery with much more precision. You are able to write with much better handwriting and for those of you who engage in public speaking, if you ever too nervous, that's why pacing while you public speak helps if you're nervous, that's why bouncing your knee behind the podium works as well. That's why nodding your head and gesticulating can help. It's not a matter of, \"Moving energy out of the body.\" That doesn't actually happen, what it is you're engaging those premotor circuits that are sending through commands. It's like trying to stuff, a bunch of stuff through a funnel, and it creates this tension, so you're giving it an outlet for the neural circuitry to be able to move something so that you can keep other components of your body and your mental attention engaged and locked onto something what we call focus. One thing related to this whole business of blinking",

This is a paper entitled, \"Decreased spontaneous eyeblink rates in chronic cannabis users, evidence for stride or cannabinoid, dopamine interactions.\" Okay, I'm not going to go into all the details here, but one thing that is somewhat surprising is that many people with ADHD use or abuse cannabis, you might think, well, why would they do that? Because I thought that a increase in dopamine is actually what's going to lead to heightened levels of attention and that's what these people in children crave. Well, it turns out that cannabis also increases dopamine transmission in the brain, but because of the other chemicals, it increases namely serotonin and some components of the cannabinoid and opioid system, it creates that kind of alert, but mellow feel and again, here I'm not a proponent of this, I personally am not a THC or cannabis user. It's just not my thing and obviously it's illegal some places and so you have to determine that for yourself it does have medical purposes in some places it is legal, but THC increases dopamine and increases neurochemicals that can also create a state of calm. So it's that sort of middle ground and this paper has a beautiful demonstration whereby not just while people are using cannabis, but depending on how long they've been using cannabis across their lifespan, the rates of eye blinking change. So if you look at the number of years that people have been using cannabis on a regular basis, either daily or up to excuse me, weekly, or up to daily, what you find is that for people that have not been using cannabis at all, or have only been using it for about two years, their rates of eye blinks are much higher than people who've been using it chronically for 10 years. In other words, people who may be using cannabis for 10 years, don't blink very often at all. Now cannabis has well known effects in depleting memory, but it does seem to engage the focus and blinking system in a way that increases focus. So basically what I'm saying is marijuana seems to increase people's focus, but then they can't remember what they were focusing on.",

                "transcript": "but then they can't remember what they were focusing on. Something I'd like to discuss just briefly is the so-called interoceptive awareness that's present in people with ADHD, both children and adults. Interoceptive awareness is one sense of one's own internal state heartbeat, breathing contact of skin with a given surface, et cetera. For a long time, there was this hypothesis, this idea that people with ADHD, were just not in touch with how they felt that somehow they weren't registering all the stuff that was going on inside them changes in heart rate and so forth and so they were behaving in a way that was dysregulated or appear dysregulated, and that if they could just learn to attend to their internal state better, that somehow they would function better in the world. Now, before we described a process, literally a 17 minute interoceptive exercise that does seem to lead to improvements in one's ability to focus for a longer period of time. However, it's very unlikely that that was due to increasing interoceptive awareness per se. It probably wasn't because people gain a much heightened or improved ability to understand what's going on internally. In fact, you can imagine how that might actually prevent one's ability to pay attention to things in the outside world. So while there is benefit to just sitting there and being in stillness, as they say, or focusing on one's breathing and internal state for sake of then accessing information in the external world, a really nice study called interoceptive awareness and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder explored whether or not interoceptive awareness was different in people with ADHD or did not have ADHD and the findings were essentially that there's no difference that people with ADHD, children, and adults, they are aware of what's going on inside them just as much as anyone else's and the typical measure of interoceptive awareness is one's ability to count their own heartbeats. This is actually challenging for some individuals and very easy for other individuals, regardless of their attentional capacity. Some people just can really feel their heartbeat without taking their pulse other people cannot and these studies are pretty straightforward to do. You ask people to sit there and to count their heartbeats, and then you are monitoring their heartbeats and you get to gauge how accurate they are. So it's important to understand that people with ADHD are in touch with how they feel. It's really a question of whether or not they can take the demands that are placed upon them and enter a cognitive state of mental state that allows them to access the information they need to access in other words, whether or not they can focus, but it is absolutely wrong to think that the child that's getting up 11 times during a short six minute interaction at the table, or whether or not a child who somehow has to venture off every moment or a coworker of yours who's an adult who's constantly fidgeting or moving things around that somehow they are unaware that they are oblivious, they're not oblivious to how they feel. Chances are they're very challenged in the situations that they're in and they're doing everything they can to try and regulate their attention. So I think it's an important study to highlight because it really underscores the fact that something else is going on and that something else has everything to do with this ability to coordinate these tasks directed networks, and to coordinate that in the proper way with that default mode network and that is a process as you now know, that's regulated exquisitely by certain neurochemicals and in particular the neurochemicals, dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin, and a fourth one I'd like to throw into the mix, which is acetylcholine, which is very vital for cognitive focus. So now I want to switch back to talking about some of the drugs that are typically used",

                "transcript": "some of the drugs that are typically used to access those systems, prescription drugs and I want to talk about some of the new and emerging non-prescription approaches to increasing the levels of dopamine, acetylcholine and serotonin in the brain using various supplement type compounds, because several of them are showing really remarkable efficacy in excellent peer reviewed studies. So before moving to some of the newer atypical compounds and things sold over the counter, I'd like to just briefly return to the classic drugs that are used to treat ADHD. These are the ones I mentioned earlier, methylphenidate also called Ritalin, Modafinil or armodafinil is another one and Adderall, again, all of these work by increasing levels of dopamine and norepinephrine. Typically they're taken orally in pill form, or sometimes in capsule form the dosages that are appropriate vary, according to severity of the condition for a given person and the age of the person. This is a complicated landscape for each individual. They have to figure out the pharmacology that's best for them. Some individuals are even layering long or time to release Ritalin with Adderall in smaller doses, it can get quite complex or it can be quite straightforward if you are really interested in these drugs and how they work and you'd like to get a glance at a table of all the results from all the studies of which there are now hundreds, there's an excellent review about these drugs and their use and their comparison to similarly structured drugs in particular MDMA and cocaine and amphetamine, meaning Street Amphetamine to really illustrate the similarities of action and some of the problems associated with long-term use. I don't expect you to read this article in full I'm here so that you don't have to go read these articles, but in case you want a ton of information, the paper is Esposito et al Frontiers and bio-sciences, it's an excellent, excellent review of the entire literature. It is quite long. I can put a link to that study in our caption, and it essentially describes all the studies that have been done, peer reviewed and published, and it refers to these drugs in an interesting way. It doesn't just refer these drugs as for treatment of ADHD. It actually refers to them using language that ordinarily I'm not very fond of, but I'll agree to here, which is so-called smart drugs or nootropics. It also covers caffeine, which again as I mentioned earlier, increases dopamine norepinephrine and to some extent serotonin, but what I like about this review so much is that in putting, these drugs of abuse, methamphetamine, and cocaine, right alongside these drugs, like Ritalin and Adderall and also caffeine, we start to realize that the distinction between drugs of abuse and the distinction between drugs of treatment is actually a very fine and sometimes even a blurry line and in thinking about whether or not one wants to use these prescription, I want to emphasize prescription, not drugs of abuse, but prescription drugs for treatment of one's own attentional capacity. I think it is important to understand the extent to which they all carry more or less the same side effects. The one exception being caffeine caffeine side effects can be anxiety if you ingest too much of it, insomnia, if you drink it too late in the day, but typically it will not cause the major side effects of the other drugs, such as high propensity for addiction and abuse. Amphetamines of any kind as well as cocaine can cause sexual side effects because they're vasoconstrictors. So, men have trouble achieving erection, there can often be the intense desire or libido for sex, but an inability to actually perform. So that's an issue with any kind of stimulant. So these drugs are not without their consequences. In addition, and here I'd lump caffeine back into the mix. In addition, they almost all carry cardiac effects, right? They increase heart rate, but they also have effects on constriction of blood vessels and arteries and veins and so forth in ways that can create cardiovascular problems. Now, caffeine is a bit of a complicated one. I talked about this on a podcast long ago, but I'll just remind you that it turns out that if you are caffeine adapted, in other words, if you are used to drinking caffeine then the ingestion of caffeine, most often will cause vasodilation who actually allow more blood flow through. However, if you are not caffeine adapted, it will cause vasoconstriction due to an increased stress response. So if you're familiar with caffeine, caffeine can actually have a little bit more of a relaxation response although if you drink enough of it, it will make you amped up. These other drugs, almost always lead to vasoconstriction, increased heart rate dilation of the pupils, less blinking, heightened levels of attention, which looks very much like stress and at its extremes looks very much like the effects of street drugs, like cocaine and amphetamine. Because of the large amounts of dopamine that released in the brain. People tend to crave that state over and over and yet with each subsequent use are able to get less and less of that euphoric feeling or that really, really focused feeling. So one thing that's being explored quite extensively now in the treatment of ADHD are drug schedules. Whether or not people should take Adderall every day or every other day, whether or not they should take it only every once in a while, whether or not young children can take it just a few times and engage in behavioral training of the sort that I talked about before, where they're doing, maybe it's a 17 minute meditation type exercise, but more likely it would be the movement followed by the visual focusing, cause that's only done for 20 or 30 or 60 seconds. Why would you do that? Well in a chemically enhanced state, your brain is more plastic. The circuits are able to modify and learn better. That's the optimal time to engage in focus in a very deliberate way. So just taking a drug and expecting focus to just work at any point and being able to turn focus on and off at will, that's an unrealistic expectation, right? More likely the best use of things like Adderall, Modafinil, armodafinil and Ritalin is going to be to combine those treatments with behavioral exercises that actively engage the very circuits that you're trying to train up and enhance and then perhaps I want to highlight perhaps tapering off those drugs so that then one can use those circuits without any need for chemical intervention. So despite any controversy that might be out there,",

                "transcript": "So despite any controversy that might be out there, I think it's fair to say that the consumption of omega-3 fatty acids can positively modulate the systems for attention and focus. So then the question becomes how much EPA, how much DHA does that differ for, what's helpful for depression, et cetera and actually it does differ in reviewing the studies for this it appears that a threshold level of 300 milligrams of DHA turns out to be an important inflection point. So typically fish oils or other sources of omega-3s will have DHA and EPA and typically it's the EPA that's harder to get at sufficient levels, meaning you have to take quite a lot of fish oil in order to get above that 1000 milligram or 2000 milligram threshold to improve mood and other functions. But for sake of attention, there are 10 studies that have explored this in detail and while the EPA component is important, the most convincing studies point to the fact that getting above 300 milligrams per day of DHA is really where you start to see the attentional effects. Now, fortunately, if you're getting sufficient EPA for sake of mood and other biological functions, almost without question, you're getting 300 milligrams or more of DHA. So that usually checks that box just fine. What's interesting is that there's another compound phosphatidylserine that has been explored for its capacity to improve the symptoms of ADHD. Again, I don't think this is any direct way, but rather in a modulatory way, but it appears that phosphatidylserine taken for two months for 200 milligrams per day, was able to reduce the symptoms of ADHD in children. It has not been looked at in adults yet as, at least as far as I know, but that this effect was greatly enhanced by the consumption of omega-3 fatty acids. So now we're starting to see synergistic effects of omega-3 fatty acids and phosphatidylserine again that was 200 milligrams per day. This is something that sold over the counter in capsule form, at least in the U.S. there were two studies, both were double-blind studies. I carried out for anywhere from one to six months on both boys and girls and it really was boys and girls, not men and women. This was kids age one to six or seven to 12, and it was a fairly large number of subjects. So 147 subjects in one case in 36 in the other, the takeaway is that getting sufficient levels of EPA and particularly there's 300 milligram threshold of DHA, plus, if you are interested in it and it's right for you, 200 milligrams of phosphatidylserine can be an important augment for improving the symptoms of ADHD. You'll also find literature out there",

Some people do not experience those headaches, but it's known to have very potent vasoconstrictive and vasodilating properties that vary depending on when you took the compound. So for those of you that are exploring Ginkgo Biloba, and you will see a lot of claims about Ginkgo Biloba for attention in ADHD definitely take the vasodilation vasoconstriction headache issue into consideration.

                "transcript": "So I'd like to talk about the drug Modafinil and the closely related drug armodafinil that's AR Modafinil. Because Modafinil and armodafinil are gaining popularity out there, both for treatment of ADHD and narcolepsy, but also for communities of people that are trying to stay awake long periods of time. So it's actively used in the military by first responders, it's gaining popularity on college campuses and people are using it more and more as an alternative to Adderall and Ritalin and excessive amounts of coffee. It does increase focus and to a dramatic extent, Modafinil typically was very expensive, I don't know if it's still this expensive, but when one has a prescription for it, it could still cost as much as eight or $900 even $1000 a month. Armodafinil is a far less expensive version, that's chemically slightly different than Modafinil. Regardless of price people are taking Modafinil and armodafinil. Want to emphasize that unlike Ritalin and Adderall, Modafinil and armodafinil are weak dopamine re-uptake inhibitors, and that's how they lead to increases in dopamine. So, whereas Ritalin and Adderall, amphetamine, and cocaine lead to big increases in dopamine also through re-uptake mechanisms and so forth Modafinil is a weaker dopamine re-uptake stimulator and so what that means is that it leaves more dopamine around to be active at the synopsis, the gaps between neurons, however, it also activates other systems. It acts on the orexin system, which is actually a peptide that we talked about in the episode on hunger, because it regulates hunger and appetite, and it regulates sleepiness and feelings of sleepiness. In fact, the, excuse me, orexin also called hypocretin system, the orexin hypocretin system is what's disrupted in narcolepsy. That was the important discovery of my colleagues, Emmanuel Mignot and Seiji Nishino at Stanford some years ago, they identified the biological basis of narcolepsy and it's a disruption in the so orexin hypocretin system and Modafinil is one of the primary treatments for narcolepsy. It also has these other effects on the dopamine system and on the norepinephrine system, even though it doesn't lead to quite as intense levels of dopamine and arousal and focus, it does have the property of raising levels of attention and focus, and that's why people are using it. So it's a somewhat milder form of Adderall. Armodafinil for some people works as well as Modafinil and as I mentioned before, it's much lower cost for other people it doesn't. I have an experience, meaning I do have an experience that I'll share with you with armodafinil. A few years ago, I was suffering from jet lag, really terribly and I was traveling overseas. I went to a meeting to give a talk, I took half of the prescribed dose of armodafinil. It was prescribed to me. I took that half dose and I gave my lecture and then I stayed around to answer questions and then four hours later, a friend of mine came up to me and said, you've been talking for four and a half hours, and they're only a few people still here. Luckily there were still a few people be a lot weirder, if the room was completely empty, 'cause it wasn't being recorded. So I have firsthand knowledge of the sorts of cognitive effects that it can create. I personally would not want to be in that state for sake of studying or learning or for doing this podcast, for instance and I can honestly say that today, all I've adjusted is some coffee and some Yerba latte tea and some water. I'm not on any of the compounds that I've described during the course of today's episode. You might ask why I took half the recommended dose of armodafinil and the reason is that I'm somebody who's fairly hypersensitive to medication of any kind, what you find if you look in the literature, is that about 5% of people are hyper hyper sensitive to medication. They require far lower doses of any medication than other people in order to experience the same effects. I'm somebody that I think has, or modest a hyper if that sort of oxymoronic statement, but a modest hypersensitivity to medication. So I've almost always been able to get by, on taking less of whatever was prescribed for me and feel just fine or in this case to feel like it was still too much, it turned out that the right dose of armodafinil for me was zero milligrams. Now you may notice that",

                "transcript": "Now you may notice that I haven't talked much about acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that at the neuron to muscle connections, the so called neuromuscular junctions is involved in generating muscular contractions of all kinds for all movements. Acetylcholine is also released from two sites in the brain. So a little bit of nomenclature here again, feel free to ignore the nomenclature, but there is a collection of neurons in your brain stem that send projections forward, kind of like a sprinkler system that's very diffuse to release acetylcholine and those neurons reside in an area or a structure that's called the pedunculopontine nucleus, the PPN and then there's a separate collection of neurons in the basal forebrain called unimaginatively nucleus basalis the nucleus at the base and they also hose the brain with acetylcholine, but in a much more specific way. So one is sort of like a sprinkler system and the other one is more like a fire hose to a particular location and those two sources of acetylcholine, collaborate to activate particular locations in the brain, and really bring about a tremendous degree of focus to whatever is happening at those particular synapses. So it could be a focus on visual information or auditory information, if you're listening closely to what I'm saying right now, and you just heard closely step out from the rest of my sentence, no doubt there was acetylcholine released at the sites in your brain where the neurons that represent your recognition of the word closely occurred, okay? So now you have an example and you have an understanding and hopefully a picture in your mind of how all this is working, not surprisingly then drugs that increase cholinergic or acetycholine transmission will increase focus and cognition. One such compound is so-called alpha GPC, which is a form of choline and increases acetycholine transmission dosages as high as 1200 milligrams per day, which has a very high dosage spread out, typically it's 300 or 400 milligrams spread out throughout the day have been shown to offset some of the effects of age-related cognitive decline, improved cognitive functioning people that don't have age-related cognitive decline that's a very high dose. Typically when people are using alpha-GPC to study or to enhance learning of any kind, they will take somewhere between 300 and 600 milligrams that's more typical. Again, you have to check with your doctor, you have to decide if the safety margins are appropriate for you obviously you'll want to check that out, but alpha-GPC is effective in creating more focused by way of this cholinergic system, It stimulates acetylcholine release from both of those locations, the PPN in the back of the brain and nucleus basalis in the front of the brain.

L-tyrosine does lead to increases in dopamine. They are fairly long lived and L-tyrosine can improve one's ability to focus, however, the dosaging can be very tricky to dial in. Sometimes it makes people feel too euphoric or too jittery or too alert that they are then unable to focus well. So the dosage ranges are huge, you see evidence for 100 milligrams all the way up to 1200 milligrams. It's something that really should be approached with caution, especially for people that have any kind of underlying psychiatric or mood disorder, because dysregulation of the dopamine system is central to many of the mood disorders such as depression, but also especially mania bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, things of that sort. So it's something that really should be approached with caution, nonetheless, in exploring what's out there and even some studies online that were done in either animal studies or human studies, it's clear that L-tyrosine is being explored for that purpose as is PEA and Phenethylamine, which is a essentially PEA, but some related compounds. So there's a whole class of dopaminergic or dopamine stimulating supplements that people are using to try and get their dopamine levels up and again, it's kind of a fine line between too little enough and too much. If you want to get the literature on those two compounds there, I will refer you to this great website at examine.com just as it sounds and you can put in L-tyrosine or PEA, and you can get the details on that. But I highly recommend also going to their section on ADHD to see how those particular comment OENs relate specifically to ADHD and cognitive focus.

These are somewhat esoteric and probably most of you haven't heard about them, but some of you probably know a lot about them and they are becoming more popular. They go by names like New pepped and things of that sort. The Racetams. are illegal in certain countries. They are gray market in other countries, and they are sold over the counter in this country, in the U.S. so they have different margins for safety you definitely need to consult your doctor, especially if you have ADHD, but new pepped has been shown when taken, at 10 milligrams, twice daily can be more effective than some of the other Racetams. What is Noopept? Noopept taps into the cholinergic system, the acetylcholine system in ways, very similar to alpha-GPC, but seems to have a slightly higher affinity for some of the receptors involved and can lead to those heightened states of cognitive capacity and there are these studies one in particular, comparative studies of new pepped, Racetams in the treatment of patients with mild cognitive disorders and brain diseases of vascular and traumatic origin. That's a mouthful. What this study basically points to is the fact that people who are experiencing some degree of inability to focus due to prior concussion or some vascular event, a stroke or a schemey of any kind, because neurons need blood, when the blood supply is cut off to neurons, or when there's a bleed in the brain. Subsequent to that, often there are challenges in maintaining focus. This is very common for people who have done sports, where there's a lot of running into each other with your head like rugby football, hockey, and so forth, but also people who have experienced head blows or often overlooked is the fact that most traumatic head injury is not actually from sports, even football it's from things like construction work from high-impact work of that kind. So there does seem to be some efficacy of new Pepped and Racetams. and things like it. It's an emerging area and as I mentioned in the U.S. these things are sold over the counter. Again, you have to figure out if it's right for you, but they are beginning to show some promise, and I'm intrigued by them because of the way that they tap into the cholinergic system, which is both directly involved in focus, and the ability to focus, but is also important for things related to age-related cognitive decline. So a decline in cholinergic transmission or acetylcholine as we call it in the brain is one of the things associated with cognitive decline and it does seem that increasing cholinergic transmission can offset some of that cognitive decline and perhaps even more so in conditions such as vascular damage or concussion to the brain. If you're interested in atypical treatments for ADHD compounds or improve focus and related themes, and you like reading about this stuff, there's an excellent review article that I can refer you to it's by Ahn et al, AHN it was published in 2016 so it's a little bit behind the times, although it's surprisingly comprehensive given that, which lines up all the various drugs that I've discussed, Racetams., and Adderall and Ritalin, and various forms of dopaminergic agents and cholinergic agents spells out whether or not they are sold over the counter by prescription, and really lines them up in all their effects, their drawbacks, et cetera. I'll refer you to that study. It's available in its full length form online for free it's Hen et al the journal is neuro plasticity, neural plasticity, 2016 should be very easy to find if you put those keywords in, and while it is a review, it is a very comprehensive review and if you're really into this stuff, and you also want to learn a thing or two about how these things interact with neurofeedback, et cetera, there's some information in there as well.

It is a non-invasive tool, it involves taking a coil it's a device with a coil that's placed over particular locations in the brain, and then sends magnetic stimulation into the brain and it can actually pass through the skull without having to drill through the skull and nowadays can be used to both lower the amount of activity or increase the amount of activity in specific brain areas. It's spatial, precision is not remarkable. That doesn't mean it's not of use, but it is not a super fine green tool, okay? It's not a canon, but it's also not a needle. It is somewhere in between. It can direct the activity of particular brain regions at particular depths and as I mentioned, it can increase or decrease that activity. So for instance, I've had a TMS coil placed on my head, not for therapeutic purposes, even it was, I wouldn't tell you, but rather just for, well, I'm a neuroscientist and I worked in a lab with one for entertainment, exploratory purposes, please don't do this at home. It was placed over my motor cortex, which generates voluntary action and it was a coil that at that time could only inhibit neurons and so what I was doing as I was moving objects around on a table, just like I am now, it was actually a pencil, not a pen and I was tapping the pencil and then the TMS coil was turned on and for the life of me, I could not move that pencil, okay? Because it was inhibiting my upper motor neurons in the portion of my cortex that controls voluntary activity. As soon as the coil was turned off, I could return to tapping the pencil again, nowadays it's possible to stimulate motor cortex or any area of the brain with some degree of precision that could create the impulse to move without actually making the decision to move. So you can literally engage certain neural circuits and therefore behaviors and certain thought and emotional patterns by way of transcranial magnetic stimulation. This has far reaching and vast implications, as you can probably imagine in discussing ADHD with a colleague that uses TMS, what they are doing is they are taking the TMS coil to children and adults that have ADHD, and they're using it to stimulate the portions of the prefrontal cortex that we talked about earlier that engage task directed focused states. So rather than using a drug that generally increases dopamine, and some of the other chemicals involved there you using directed TMS stimulation of the circuits and fortunately, I was quite relieved to hear this, they are combining that with a focused learning task. So they're literally teaching the brain to learn in a noninvasive way, no drug at all and right now there are experiments clinical trials going on, comparing TMS of this sort to the drug treatments of the sort that we described earlier that engaged these circuits through pharmacologic mechanisms. So very exciting times for TMS, very exciting times for pharmacology related to ADHD and for enhancing focus in general and when I say very exciting times, I mean, no drug is perfect, but the constellation of drugs that's out there is getting much larger, but because they tap into different aspects of their circuitry, I do think that we are well on our way to identifying the ideal combinations of drug treatments, technological treatments, and behavioral paradigms for increasing focus in both children and adults with ADHD. And as a final final point,",

                "transcript": "And as a final final point, I also want to mention something about technologies that are making it harder for all of us to focus, regardless of whether or not we have pre-existing ADHD or not. You can probably guess where this is going. Everybody nowadays seems to have a smartphone. I'm sure there are a few individuals out there that don't have a smartphone. Nonetheless, most people have them. Most kids want one, as soon as they can get them and they are small, they grab our attention entirely. But within that small box of attention, there are millions of attentional windows scrolling by, right? So just because it's one device that we look at does not mean that we are focused, we are focused on our phone, but because of the way, in which context switches up so fast within the phone, it's thought that the brain is struggling now to leave that rapid turnover of context, right? Many, many shows, many, many Instagram pages, many, many Twitter feeds many, many websites. Basically the whole world, at least in virtual format is available within that small box. Unlike any other technology humans have ever dealt with before, even though there are trillions infinite number of bits of information in the actual physical world, your attentional window, that aperture of constriction and dilating that visual window is the way in which you cope with all that overwhelming information typically. Well within the phone, your visual aperture is set to a given width it's about this big, typically the phone seem to be getting bigger, but nonetheless, it's about that big and within there, your attentional window is grabbing it near infinite number of bits of information, colors, movies. If a picture is worth 1000 words, a movie is worth a billion pictures, the brain loves visual motion and so the question is, does that sort of interaction on a regular basis lead to deficits in the types of attention that we need in order to perform well in work, in school, relationships, et cetera and the short answer is yes, it does appear so we are inducing a sort of ADHD and while the studies on this are ongoing because prominent use of smartphones really took off right around 2010 and we're only in 2021 longstanding studies take time, which is essentially to say the same thing as long standing. There are some studies and one in particular that I'd like to highlight one was actually carried out pretty early in 2014. This is a study that explored smartphone use at the time they called it mobile phone use, but smartphone use and inattention, difficulties in attending in 7,102 adolescents that's a huge study, a population based cross-sectional study and you will be probably surprised and somewhat dismayed to hear that in order to avoid this decrease in attentional capacity, adolescents needed to use their smartphone for less than 60 minutes per day, in order to stay focused and centered on their other tasks. Otherwise they started to really run into significant issues. So 60 minutes is not much, I've a feeling that most young people are using their phone more than 60 minutes per day, I know I am. I think for adults, the number's probably higher meaning if you're an adult, I'm going to just extrapolate from what I read in this study. It seems that probably two hours a day on the phone would be the upper limit beyond which you would probably experience pretty severe attentional deficits. I'm a big fan of Cal Newport who wrote the book \"Deep work.\" He's also written an excellent book, \"A world without Email.\" I've never met him, but I'm a huge admirer of his work and I will paraphrase something that he said far more eloquently than I ever could, which is that the brain does not do well with constant context switching, meaning it can do it, but it diminishes our capacity to do meaningful work of any other kind. And so Cal, as I understand is very he's our computer science professor at Georgetown, by the way, is very structured and very disciplined in his avoidance of cell phone use. I think we're all striving to do that. I'm not here to tell you what to do, but I think whether or not you have ADHD or not, if you're an adolescent limiting your smartphone use to 60 minutes per day or less and if you are an adult to two hours per day or less is going to be among the very best ways to maintain, just to maintain your ability to focus at whatever level you can now and as I always say, most of the things that we get recognized for in life success in life, in every endeavor, whether or not it's school relationships, sport, creative works of any kind are always proportional to the amount of focus that we can bring that activity. It is important to rest of course, to get proper sleep. But I stand behind that statement and I leave you with that study about attention and cell phones and how cell phones are indeed eroding our attentional capacities. So I realized I covered a lot of information about ADHD",

We also talked about over the counter compounds, the role of particular types of diets and elimination diets and we talked about interactions between these various features in dictating outcomes for ADHD and enhancing focus in general, we also talked a little bit about emerging neurotechnologies and how certain technologies like the smartphone are no doubt hindering our ability to focus and put us at greater risk of developing ADHD at all ages.

So the first question, which had a lot of upvotes-- meaning many people wanted the answer to this question-- came from Jackson Lipfert. And the question was about so-called ultradian rhythms. For those of you that are not familiar with ultradian rhythms-- ultradian rhythms are any rhythms that are shorter than 24 hours. And typically when people ask about",

And Jackson's question was-- how do you use ultradian rhythms in your daily work? There's more to the question, but first off, I do use ultradian rhythms-- that is, I leverage the fact that these do exist in all of us as a way to engage in focused bouts of mental work once or twice, or sometimes three times per day. However, I use them in a way that's grounded in the research on ultradian rhythms for learning and memory in a way that might not be obvious just from their name that they are 90-minute rhythms. So I'll get into the details of how to use ultradian rhythms to best capture neuroplasticity-- that is the brain's ability to change in response to experience-- and in a way that should allow you to get one or two, or maybe even three focused bouts of learning per day, which can greatly accelerate learning of cognitive material, languages, mathematics, history-- for sake of school or work, or maybe just a hobby, or a personal interest of some sort-- and for skill learning in the physical domain as well. Jackson then went on to ask-- you've mentioned before that you try to include at least one 90-minute focus block per day as part of your work and overall mission. And indeed, that is true. I tried to get at least one of these focused ultradian rhythm blocks per day. That is a period of about 90 minutes",

                "transcript": "That is a period of about 90 minutes where I'm focused on learning something or doing something that's cognitively hard, although typically I aim for two of these sessions per day. He then goes on to ask-- what is the maximum number of blocks you can perform sustainably? The answer to that is probably four. And I say probably because some people have schedules, lifestyles, in which four 90-minute blocks of focused learning is possible per day, but that's highly unusual. For most people, it's going to be one or two, maybe three-- four, I would place in the really extraordinary end of things, maybe if you're cramming for exams or you've managed to go on a writing retreat or a learning and retreat of some sort where you can devote essentially, all of your non-sleeping, non-eating time to learning. But most people simply can't organize their life that way. So the short answer is-- for me, it's one or two per day is the target and three would be the maximum. You then went on to ask-- do you take vacations or extended breaks from these ultradian rhythm sessions? And the short answer is no. Typically, I try and do this every day-- and yes, even on the weekends. But on the weekend, the ultradian rhythm focused learning bout might just be reading a book for about 90 minutes or so, which might not be as cognitively difficult as it is for other sorts of work that I perform during the week. I occasionally miss a day entirely for whatever reason-- travel, obligations related to family, et cetera. But in general, I try and do this every day.",

But essentially, that accessing the circuits for focus is made easier by accessing them regularly and that's because the circuits for focus are indeed themselves amenable to neuroplasticity. In other words, the more you force yourself to focus, the easier focusing gets. I'll now answer the last part of the question and then I will go through and emphasize some tools that anyone can use in order to leverage ultradian rhythms toward learning bouts-- either cognitive learning or physical skill learning, or a combination of the two. The last part of the question Jackson asked was-- if you knew you needed to drastically increase the amount of focus you do daily, how would you schedule that focus and recover from it? That's an excellent aspect to this question. And I will now give you the details of how I would use and schedule ultradian rhythms. I'll offer you a tool-- I've never talked about this tool in the Huberman Lab podcast.

                "transcript": "So as I mentioned before, ultradian rhythms are these 90-minute cycles that we go through from the time that we are born until the time we die. Indeed, even during sleep, we are experiencing and more or less governed by these ultradian rhythms. This question and this answer is not so much about sleep. But just know that when you go to sleep at night until you wake up in the morning, every 90 minutes or so, your patterns of sleep-- that is the percentage or ratio rather of slow wave sleep to light sleep to rapid eye movement sleep changes in a way such that each 90-minute cycle gates the next cycle. It flips on switch for the next 90-minute cycle then that 90-minute cycle ends, flips on switch for the next one, and so on and so forth. I mentioned all that because during the daytime, the same thing is true. But most people don't know when the 90-minute all trading cycles begin. Because if you think about it, you could wake up on the basis of an alarm clock or noise in the room, or simply because you naturally wake up in the middle of an ultradian 90-minute cycle. So does that mean, for instance, that if you wake up 60 minutes into an ultradian cycle that the next 30 minutes of your waking-- right, because that 60 minutes needs to continue to 90 to complete an ultradian cycle-- that the next 30 minutes after waking are related to the ultradian cycle that you were still in during sleep, or does it start a new ultradian cycle. And the answer is the former. That ultradian cycle continues even if you wake up in the middle of it. And so a lot of people who want to leverage ultradian cycles",

Can I just set a clock and work for 90 minutes?\" And the short answer is no. And that might seem unfortunate, but the good news is that you can figure out when your first proper ultradian cycle of the day begins simply by asking yourself when are you most alert after waking. That is if you were, say to wake up at 7:00 AM and let's say that's the end of an ultradian cycle or perhaps you're in the middle of an ultradian cycle-- doesn't matter. What you need to watch for or pay attention to for a day or so is when you start to experience your greatest state of mental alertness in the morning. And here, we can discard with all the issues and variables around caffeine or no caffeine, hydrating or no hydrating. Exercise is one variable that we'll consider in a moment. But here's the deal-- these all trading in cycles are actually triggered by fluctuations in the so-called glucocorticoid system-- the system that regulates cortisol release. And as some of you have probably heard me say before-- cortisol, even though it's often discussed as a terrible thing, it's chronic stress, cortisol, cortisol, et cetera-- cortisol is essential for health and every day we get a rise in cortisol in the morning that is associated with enhanced immune function, enhanced alertness, enhanced ability to focus, so on and so forth. In fact, the protocol that I'm always beating the drum about that people should get sunlight in their eyes as close to waking as possible-- that actually enhances or increases the peak level of cortisol that's experienced early in the day. And that sets in motion a number of these ultradian cycles. So for instance, if you wake up at 7:00 AM and you find that for the first hour after waking, you tend to be a little bit groggy, or you happen to be groggy on a given day,",

                "transcript": "or you happen to be groggy on a given day, but then you notice that your attention and alertness starts to peak somewhere around 9:30 AM or 10:00 AM, you can be pretty sure that, that first ultradian cycle for learning is going to be optimal to start at about 9:30 or 10:00 AM. How can I say about if it's indeed a 90-minute cycle? Well, this is really where the underlying neurobiology in these ultradian cycles converge to give you a specific protocol. The changes in cortisol that occur throughout the day involve-- yes, a big peak early in the day if you're getting your sunlight and caffeine and maybe even some exercise early in the day. But typically, that peak comes early. And then across the day the baseline jitters a little bit, it comes down, but it bounces around a little bit. It's not a flat line, if we were to measure your glucocorticoid levels. Each one of those little bumps corresponds to a shift in these ultradian cycles. So if you find that you are most alert at 9:30 or starting to become alert at 9:30, and then typically you have a peak of focus and concentration around 10:00 AM, that is really valuable to know. Because the way that the molecules that control neuroplasticity-- that is the changes in neurons and other cell types in the brain that allow your nervous system to learn and literally for new connections to form between neurons, which is basically the basis of learning-- those fluctuate according to these ultradian cycles. What does this mean? This means if your peak in alertness and focus and energy-- could even be experienced as physical energy occurs at about 9:30 AM, I would start your first ultradian cycle for learning somewhere around there. Certainly 9:30 AM would be ideal, but 10:00 AM would be fine as well. And then you have about one hour to get the maximum amount of learning in even within that alternating cycle.

In reality, most people take about 10 or 15 minutes to break into a really deep trench of focus and then periodically throughout the next hour, they'll pop out of that focus, now have to deliberately refocus. This is why, if possible, you want to turn off Wi-Fi connections and put your phone in the other room or turn it off. If. You do need your phone or Wi-Fi, just be aware of how distracting those things can be to getting into a deep trench of focus. But the point is this-- these 90-minute cycles occur periodically throughout the day, but there is going to be one period early in the day-- and here, I'm referring to the spirit of starting at about 9:30 or 10:00 AM-- and then likely another one in the mid to late afternoon that are going to be ideal for focused learning. And that focus learning bout should ideally have you set your clock-- a stopwatch or something-- to measure 90 minutes, but do assume that there's going to be some jitter at the front end where you're not going to be able to focus as deeply as you would like. Then you'll get about an hour of deep focus and then you really start to transition out of these ultradian cycles. How do when the afternoon ultradian cycle occurs?",

But you can learn to recognize when these two periods for optimized learning will occur and here are the key principles. Watch for a day or two-- meaning pay attention to when you have your peak levels of physical and mental energy in the morning-- that is between waking and noon, and then again between noon and about 6:00 or 7:00 PM. Although I'm sure that there are some late shifted folks that will experience their peak in focus somewhere around 6:00 or 7:00 PM, especially if they're waking up around 10:00 or 11:00 AM, as I know some people out there are. Once you know where those peaks in focus occur on your schedule, set a stopwatch for one ultradian cycle in the early part of the day. In this example, I was saying 9:30, but if you can't hop on it until 10, that's fine. Set it for 90 minutes, consider that block wholly-- meaning rule out all other distractions. But assume that within that 90-minute block, you are only going to be able to focus intensely for about one hour. And just know that the molecules that control neuroplasticity-- and these things have names. And yes, Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor or BDNF is the most famous of those, but there are others as well. In fact, the very receptors that control synaptic strength, the connections between neurons, some of the neurotransmitters and modulators involved in synaptic plasticity, they undergo regulation by these ultradian changes in glucocorticoid. And then try and capture a second ultradian learning block in the afternoon. Again, just knowing that the first 10 or 15 minutes, consider it mental warm up, and then you get about an hour-- it's not exactly 60 minutes, but about an hour to maximize learning. So if you're trying to learn something,",

                "transcript": "So if you're trying to learn something, really capture it during that phase as well. Now, is there a third opportunity or a fourth opportunity? This relates to Jackson's question directly. And the short answer is not really, unless you're somebody who requires very little sleep. Within the 12 or 16 hours that one tends to be awake during the day or 18 hours that one tends to be awake, there are really only two of these major peaks in the glucocorticoid system that trigger the onset of the circadian cycles. Again, there's a ramping up and a ramping down of glucocorticoids throughout the day. But the real key here is to learn when you tend to be most focused based on your regular sleep, wake cycle, caffeine intake, exercise, et cetera. And again, that's going to vary from person to person. And you really only have two opportunities or two ultradian cycles to capture in order to get the maximum focus challenging work done a.k.a. learning. So for somebody that wants to learn an immense amount of material or who has the opportunity to capture another ultradian cycle, the other time where that tends to occur is also early days. So some people by waking up early and using stimulants like caffeine and hydration or some brief high-intensity exercise, can trigger that cortisol pulse to shift a little bit earlier so that they can capture a morning work block that occurs somewhere, let's say between 6:00 and 7:30 AM. So let's think about our typical person-- at least in my example that's waking up around 7:00 AM. And then I said, has their first ultradian work cycle really flip on because that bump in cortisol around 9:30 or 10:00 AM. If that person were say to set their alarm clock for 5:30 AM, then get up, get some artificial light-- if the sun isn't out, turn on bright or artificial lights, or if the sun happens to be up that time of year, get some sunlight in your eyes. But irrespective of sunlight, were to get a little bit of brief high intensity",

                "transcript": "to get a little bit of brief high intensity exercise maybe 10 or 15 minutes of skipping rope or even just Jumping Jacks or go out for a brief jog, what happens then is the cortisol pulse starts to shift earlier. And so the next day and the following day and so on and so forth-- provided they're still doing that exercise first thing and ideally getting some light in their eyes as well-- well then they have an opportunity to capture an increase in cortisol that is now shifted from about 7:00 AM to about 8:30 AM. So they can capture an hour of work there and then they will also still be within that rising phase of cortisol in the 9:30 to 10:00 AM block that lasts until about 11:30 or so. They might have lunch. Perhaps after lunch, they do a Non-Sleep Deep Rest-- maybe they, don't maybe you're a napper or maybe you're not-- doesn't really matter. And then in the afternoon-- and I would suspect it would now be in the earlier afternoon sometime around 2:00 or 2:30 would be typical. Although again, that exact time will vary person to person. Then they would want to schedule another 90-minute work block. So that's how you can capture three. Now you can start to see also why capturing four ultradian work blocks would be exceedingly rare. It's just not typical that people are awake for that much of the day, you have to sleep at some point. And I should mention that if you're going to force yourself to wake up earlier on a consistent basis, you probably should be trying to get to sleep a little bit earlier as well. Because it's not just the quality, but the duration of quality sleep that really matters for learning. And I should also remind everybody that the actual rewiring of neurons does not occur during any focused work block, it actually occurs during deep sleep the following night and the following night, and during Non-Sleep Deep Rest. This is why Non-Sleep Deep Rest can accelerate learning because it's in states of rest that the actual connections between neurons strengthen or weaken or new neurons are added in a way that allows for what we call learning. OK. So one or two all trading work blocks per day is typical,",

Look for them-- meaning look to see when you are feeling most focused and alert typically in the period before waking and noon and typically in the period between noon and bedtime, given your standard intake of caffeine and exercise and other life events. Please also remember that even though it's an ultradian 90-minute work block, the neuroplasticity is going to be best triggered within a 60-minute portion of that. And there's no way to know exactly when that 60 minutes begins and ends until you actually begin the work block. So this is really designed to be empirical, you need to actually go do this. What you'll notice again is that it's hard to focus at first then you'll drop into a state of focus. You may get distracted, that's perfectly normal. You refocus, get back into triggering learning-- that's really what you're doing, you're triggering learning-- and then there'll be some taper and then you'll be out of the ultradian work block. Now, it's also a key to understand that myself and other people should not expect that they're only working during these 90-minute work blocks. It's just that a lot of the sorts of demands of our day, including cooking and shopping for groceries, and email, and text messaging, and social media-- a lot of those things don't require intense focus of the sort that I believe Jackson is asking about maximizing, and that I'm referring to when I talk about these ultradian work blocks. And then as a final point, I've been talking about these ultradian work blocks and focus, et cetera, in a context that brings to mind ideas about cognitive work.

So if you are somebody who's really interested in improving your fitness and your fitness requires a lot of focused attention-- so for instance, when I go out for a long run on Sundays, which is part of my fitness routine, I deliberately not thinking about much, I'm just trying to cruise along. I might focus a little bit on my pace in stride, maybe an audiobook I'm listening to or a podcast. But typically, I'm just cruising along, it's low cognitive demand work. These ultradian work blocks can really be maximized for pure cognitive work-- book type work, et cetera, music, et cetera, or they can also be leveraged toward skill learning. So if you're trying to learn how to dance or how to perform a particular athletic move or you're trying to get better at some skill that requires a lot of focus and alignment of muscular movement and cognitive demands, et cetera, well then these are also going to be ideal for triggering neuroplasticity to get better in the motor skill based domain as it's called, et cetera.

It's a vast literature and one that I'd be happy to teach you in a standard podcast episode. But in the interest of getting to more questions from you all, hopefully the answer I've given you now has been complete enough, yet clear enough, and yet succinct enough that you can start to leverage these really powerful aspects of iterative metaplasticity and ultradian rhythms for learning. And I'd just like to point out that these opportunities for focused learning that occur in these 90-minute ultradian cycles are really terrific opportunities. They are offered to you at least twice every day and you can really learn to detect when they occur and when they're likely to occur. You can certainly learn at other times in the 24-hour cycle. But for anyone who's tried to stay up late at night cramming for an exam or for somebody who's tried to learn during the sleepiest time of their afternoon, we can be very familiar with the fact that there are times of day in which we are best at learning. And as I've just described, there are ways to capture those moments and they are valuable moments. So even though it's just about three hours per day or really only two hours per day because of the 60 to 90-minute thing that I talked about a few minutes ago, learn to know when these occur and really treat them as valuable, maybe even wholly in the sense that they are really the times that are offered up to you each day by your own biology in ways that will allow you to get better pretty much at anything.

To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these Ask Me Anything sessions, plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the Huberman Lab podcast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. Just to remind you why we launched the Huberman Lab podcast premium channel-- it's really twofold. First of all, it's to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which of course, will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length. We are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast. And to fund research-- in particular, research done on human beings. So not animal models, but on human beings, which I think we all agree is the species that we are most interested in. And we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance. And those protocols will be distributed through all channels. Not just the premium channel, but through all channels-- Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. So the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now an especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the Tiny Foundation has generously offered to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel. So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science related tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to sign up for the Huberman Lab Premium channel, again there's a cost of $10 per month or you can pay $100 up front for the entire year. That will give you access to all the AMAs you can ask questions and get answers to your questions and you'll of course get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well. There will also be some premium content such as transcripts of the AMAs and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman Lab podcast episodes and not found elsewhere. And again, you'll be supporting research for mental health, physical health, and performance. You can sign up for the premium channel by going to hubermanlab.com/premium. Again, that's hubermanlab.com/premium. And as always, thank you for your interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]",

The person asks about the role of sunlight, the role of calming sounds, the role of observing wildlife, of observing green colors, and, quote, \"other stuff.\" And in fact, I'm glad that they asked about \"other stuff\" because I get the question about the scientifically-supported benefits of nature a lot. I often also get the question about grounding. For those of you that aren't familiar with what grounding is, grounding is a practice of putting your feet on the Earth directly with bare feet, oftentimes into soil or on a lawn. And it's a question that I seem to get more and more. In fact, every week for quite a long while now, on social media or elsewhere, somebody asks me about the scientific support for this practice of grounding. So obviously there's a lot of interest in what the scientific research says about getting into nature and putting one's feet on the ground, a.k.a. grounding, and so on. OK, so if I'm going to answer this question, I first have to be very direct with you. There is excellent, meaning dozens, if not hundreds, of quality peer-reviewed studies which support the value of getting sunlight in one's eyes, in particular early in the day to set your circadian rhythm. This is something that I've talked about extensively on the Huberman Lab podcast and as a guest on other podcasts. It's one of the first and, frankly, most important items on the toolkit for sleep, which is a zero-cost toolkit that you can access by going to hubermanlab.com, going to the menu, going to Newsletter. You can see it as a PDF there. You don't have to sign up for the newsletter. You can just access that toolkit for sleep. And you'll notice that very close to the top of that list, if not top of that list, is to get sunlight in your eyes early in the day. You don't have to see the sun cross the horizon. If you can, that's great. But if you wake up after the sun has already risen, go outside, face the sun, blink as necessary to protect your eyes, but get some sunlight into your eyes every single day or as often as you possibly can, especially on overcast days. That's an absolutely unequivocally science-supported tool that will increase daytime mood, focus, and alertness and will improve your nighttime sleep. Viewing morning sunlight also has profoundly positive effects on metabolism. Now, those effects on metabolism could be the direct effect of viewing sunlight or, more likely, they are the indirect consequence of getting better sleep at night. So getting sunlight in your eyes early in the day and ideally in the evening or late afternoon before the sun sets is a very well supported protocol that we know is beneficial for numerous aspects of mental health, physical health, and performance. And of course, sunlight and getting sunlight in one's eyes",

                "transcript": "And of course, sunlight and getting sunlight in one's eyes does require that you get outside. You simply will not derive the same benefits from viewing sunlight if you try and do it through a window or windshield or if you look at a picture of a sun on a screen. Forget it. You are not going to set your circadian rhythm. You are not going to derive all the positive effects of sunlight by trying to get it from screens or from looking at pictures of suns or something of that sort. Now, if you are somebody that, for whatever reason-- seasonality, where you live on the planet, work schedule, et cetera-- who cannot get sunlight in your eyes early in the day on a consistent basis, well, then you might consider purchasing a so-called SAD lamp, which is for seasonal affective disorder, which is very bright light that you can look at in the morning for usually about 5 to 10 minutes. People will put it on their counter while they make their morning coffee, eat their breakfast. And that has also been shown to improve mood, focus, and alertness and set one's circadian rhythm. But it is not nearly as effective as getting sunlight in your eyes. Now, why am I talking about this practice that I've already talked about extensively on numerous podcasts before? Well, because the question is about nature, and sunlight is a key feature of our natural environment. But the person is also asking about other features of nature-- seeing green colors, or blue colors, or running streams for that matter. Well, here, too, we can ask, what does the scientific data really say about things like going near a waterfall, or a running stream, or being near an ocean? And actually, this is quite interesting. There is actually a peer-reviewed literature on negative ionization, as it's called, which is a pattern of ionization that's present close to bodies of water and particular types of bodies of water, such as waterfalls, running streams, et cetera. There's actually a laboratory at Columbia University School of Medicine that has published fairly extensively on the health benefits of negative ionization as it relates to setting circadian rhythm and some other aspects of mental and physical health. I intend to host the head of that laboratory on the Huberman Lab podcast in the not too distant future. For now, we can safely say this-- there does seem to be some positive health benefits to placing oneself near bodies of water, in particular moving bodies of water. And of course, as is always the case when there's a discovery about how the natural world can impact health, there have been some technologies developed to create negative patterns of ionization within a home environment. But as with viewing sunlight exposure and comparing it to, say, SAD lamps, the negative ionization machines that one can purchase and put in their home environment have been shown in a few studies to produce some positive health benefits. But those positive effects in no way reach the level of positive effects that have been demonstrated in studies where people are actually spending a dedicated period of time outdoors as near a moving body of water. So in thinking about nature, natural environments,",

                "transcript": "So in thinking about nature, natural environments, there's strong evidence for getting sunlight in one's eyes. There is some evidence for being near moving bodies of water, perhaps-- again, I really want to highlight perhaps-- because of negative ionization created by those moving bodies of water. There is far less evidence for sunlight simulators or negative ionization machines used indoors. And then the asker of this question also, quite correctly, asked about things like calming sounds, watching wildlife, green colors, et cetera. And herein lies a really important point for everyone to digest. While, of course, answering a question about the natural world or about health requires that we first pose a hypothesis-- for those of you that aren't familiar what a hypothesis is, a hypothesis is a stated prediction. So it's not a question. A question would be something like, is getting out into nature good for our health? A scientific hypothesis is where one actually takes a stance. For instance, you could take the stance and make the hypothesis that getting out into nature for 30 minutes per day, three days per week, improves mood and nighttime sleep. So that's a hypothesis that then one would go on to design an experiment to test and then evaluate the data from that experiment and compare it to the hypothesis, either validating or negating that hypothesis. That's essentially how science is done. There's a lot more to it, but that's essentially the scientific method. And while, of course, the scientific method is a fabulously powerful tool, for some questions, it is a less potent tool. And the question of is getting out into nature helpful for enhancing our mental and physical health is the sort of question that while ideally you could design a really well controlled study to address, it's actually quite difficult to design such a study. And here's why. In order to perform a study that's very well controlled, meaning where you can isolate individual variables-- like sunlight, like the sorts of color contrast that one sees in a natural scene outdoors in a forest or near a river-- in order to address whether or not the calming sounds or the presence of squirrels running through your environment are the relevant factors, it becomes incredibly difficult to try and isolate individual variables, meaning as soon as you bring people into the laboratory, yes, you have more control over which variables, as they're called, you present them, by bringing them into a room that essentially has no art on the walls and then having them look at a picture of a sun or looking at sunlight or listening to soothing sounds or looking at a picture of a forest, of course, you're controlling the individual variables. However, there is a sort of gestalt, meaning a collective picture of being in nature that brings together lots of different elements-- the element of surprise, for instance.",

It had been chewed down to the cob. And the squirrel was probably only about 7 or 8 inches long, and the pine cone was probably about 9 or 10 inches long-- the cob of the pine cone, that is. And the interesting thing is that the squirrel was carrying it long ways from the tip of the cob. And so I delighted in the fact that this little squirrel was working so hard to carry this object through the woods. And this object was literally longer than its own body length, and it looked so dedicated in its running across the path in order to do whatever it would with that pine cone cob. So something like that obviously stuck in my memory. It delighted me. And at the very same time, there were a number of other things happening besides the presence of that novel wildlife experience. There was the sound of a stream. There's the sunlight. There's the color contrast everywhere. I'm breathing fresh air because I was far away from any cars or any civilization, in fact. And so here's what we know. There are dozens, if not hundreds, of studies that show that if people get out of doors into nature-- this could be parks. This could be near a stream. This could be an ocean, any number of different natural environments. And if they do that for anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes, three to seven days per week, indeed there are demonstrated significant reductions in things like blood pressure, resting heart rate, improvements in sleep, improvements in mood. And so I think we can very reliably say that, yes, or perhaps even absolutely yes, getting outside into nature can enhance various aspects of mental health, physical health, and thereby performance in different aspects of life. However, when talking about the benefits of getting into nature, we are talking about hundreds, if not thousands, of variables, some of which we are aware of, such as the presence of wildlife or sunlight or color contrast. And then, of course, there are going to be dozens, if not hundreds, maybe even thousands of other variables that we're not even aware of. Perhaps it's negative ionization. Most people aren't measuring the ionization of the air when they go out into nature. But perhaps it's also the presence of certain smells from the soils that are being broken down and then they're changing the oxygenation state of the air around you, the plants, et cetera. Again, so many variables, that, frankly, to try and isolate any one of those variables in the laboratory seems not just artificial, but I think that it actually would just lead to a diminished sense of just how valuable nature is. So while, of course, the Huberman Lab podcast is a podcast where we always center on science and science-related tools, meaning protocols that are grounded in quality peer-reviewed studies that have been subjected to control conditions where some people are getting, say, the drug treatment or taking the supplement or doing a particular behavioral practice and other people are not or doing some variant of those and dose response curves, all of that stuff, when it comes to the question of whether or not it's valuable to get out into nature, I think it's a very straightforward yes. Absolutely yes. Get out into nature as often as you can and safely can,",

                "transcript": "Get out into nature as often as you can and safely can, of course. I realize some of this is weather permitting. People live in different areas. Some people are in cities. Some people are in deserts. Some people are near the ocean. But getting out into nature has been shown over and over again to have numerous positive health effects. And yet, unless we're talking about sunlight exposure and isolating the variable of setting one's circadian rhythm by viewing sunlight early in the day, all of the other features of getting out into nature, things like forest bathing-- this is a term coined from some, frankly, pretty nice studies that were done in Japan in which people placed themselves into forest-like environments for a certain period of time. There were control groups where people were not placed into those environments, and the people that did this so-called forest bathing experienced enhanced mental and physical health. That brought on a practice of people who could not get out of doors into forests bringing plants into their home environment, which I think all of us would agree look nice. They often will add pleasant odors to the air, and perhaps they do actually shift our mental and physical health in significant ways. I suppose it depends on how much you like plants, how much you pay attention to them, and, of course, how many plants there are. But-- and I think this is a really important \"but\" to emphasize-- while most all questions about tools and protocols for enhancing health immediately lead me to say, ah, this study or that study or, yes, there's evidence or, no, there isn't evidence, when it comes to questions about nature and grounding in particular, I take the stance that this is a unique instance where we know there are just so many benefits of getting out into nature that trying to isolate any one of those variables in a quality, rigorous way within the laboratory almost seems too artificial to really justify the conclusions that arrive. Now, I'm sure there are some of you out there who are aware-- and if you're not, I'll tell you-- there are studies that have explored this practice of so-called grounding. They've had people come into the laboratory and place their feet on soil that is contained within a box or there are other studies where they actually have people go out of doors and place their feet onto the grass or the ground. And there are a bunch of theories as to how grounding could improve one's mental and physical health that aren't just about getting outside. So the theories go that this has to do with the exchange of electrons with the Earth and the Earth's surface in particular. There's been the argument made that shoes, in particular shoes that have rubber soles, may block some of this electron exchange with the surface of the Earth. There have been theories about the tactile-- that is, the touch sensation-- with the Earth being important. Not a lot of science published in, let's just say, blue ribbon journals, which is not to diminish some of the journals that these have been published in, but just to say that, again, there are so many variables associated with a practice such as grounding that I'll simply say, yes, please do get out of doors into nature. I try every Sunday to do my zone 2 cardio by rucking or jogging or hiking, often with other people if I'm trying to be social with family or others. But the point is getting out of doors has myriad positive effects on mental health and physical health. And of course, when you're moving out of doors, you're also getting that zone 2 cardio or other forms of physical benefit by elevating your heart rate or perhaps you could even do your resistance training out of doors on other days. Now, I also try to get out of doors other days of the week. But oftentimes, I'm, by way of weather or by way of other commitments, forced to be indoors, on planes, here at the podcast studio where certainly I'm indoors. But I try and get out of doors at least a few minutes each day for a morning stroll, looking at sunlight, et cetera. So the long and short of this is, yes, there's some evidence for grounding. Is it super strong evidence? No, it's not. We don't really know what it is about placing one's feet onto the Earth that is producing the positive effects that were observed in those studies. And those studies made some reasonable attempt to isolate the variables and figure out whether or not it was ion exchange with the Earth or the tactile, meaning the touch sensation, of having one's feet on the ground. Frankly, I don't think there's enough quality science to really draw any firm conclusions about that. However, if you like the idea of grounding, by all means, do it. In fact, if it feels good to you,",

                "transcript": "In fact, if it feels good to you, I recommend getting your morning sunlight out of doors with your bare feet on the ground. Or if you're like me, you put on your shoes, and you take a walk most days. Although, I've tried this practice of grounding, and it feels pretty good, meaning it feels nice to have my feet on the Earth, provided I'm on clean soil or clean lawn. Definitely don't do this at the dog park. Hookworm is a real thing, by the way, folks. So pay attention to the sorts of surfaces that you're putting your feet onto. But the question about whether or not nature is valuable for our mental and physical health is an easy one. It's an absolute yes. But isolating the particular variables about nature that are most beneficial, well, that's a much tougher question, and it's one that, frankly, the scientific method is not and, to be honest, I don't think ever will be in a position to isolate and really nail down specifically, because as soon as you get specific about that question, you start to diminish the value of the study itself. So the long and short of this is get out into nature as often as you safely can. If you can exercise out of doors, even better. If you want to make it social, great. If you don't want to make it social, fine. It's your life. It's up to you. But there certainly is value in getting out into nature. It's also just beautiful from a visual perspective, from an auditory perspective. And I myself try and take at least a few trips each year. None of these are particularly expensive trips where I try and get out hiking, camping. The weekly walks in nature are an absolute must for me. If I miss one because of weather conditions or travel, I make it a point to try and get into nature more during the following week or whenever I can. And frankly, I don't have a scientific explanation for why nature is oh-so beneficial, except for the sunlight piece and perhaps this grounding piece and the negative ionization piece. And frankly, I don't worry so much about the lack of variable-isolating, quality, peer-reviewed studies that support the benefits of getting out into nature. I simply like getting out into nature and into different natural environments as much as I possibly can, because, for whatever reason, imagine those reasons have something to do with serotonin, dopamine, hormones, oxytocin, probably a bunch of different things that are rooted in how our nervous system evolved in natural environments. Well, it just feels really good. Thank you for joining for the beginning of this Ask Me Anything episode. To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these Ask Me Anything sessions, plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the Huberman Lab podcast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. Just to remind you why we launched the Huberman Lab podcast premium channel, it's really twofold. First of all, it's to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which, of course, will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length. We are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast. And to fund research-- in particular, research done on human beings, so not animal models, but on human beings, which I think we all agree is a species that we are most interested in. And we are going to specifically one research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance. And those protocols will be distributed through all channels, not just the premium channel, but through all channels, Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. So the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the Tiny Foundation has generously offered to do dollar-for-dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel. So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science-related tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to sign up for the Huberman Lab Premium channel, again, there's a cost of $10 per month, or you can pay $100 up front for the entire year. That will give you access to all the AMAs. You can ask questions and get answers to your questions. And you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well. There will also be some premium content, such as transcripts of the AMAs and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman Lab podcast episodes not found elsewhere. And again, you'll be supporting research for mental health, physical health, and performance. You can sign up for the premium channel by going to hubermanlab.com/premium. Again, that's hubermanlab.com/premium. And as always, thank you for your interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]",

It's something that plagues many people. That is, a lot of people have challenges with task switching. It's also a topic that people will often confuse with cognitive flexibility. All of us, unless it's been removed, have an area of our brain called the prefrontal cortex. The words prefrontal cortex actually refers to a fairly varied real estate within the human brain. It's not one area of the human brain. Prefrontal cortex actually includes a lot of different subdivisions that do different things in the context of cognition and directing action, withholding action, these kinds of things.

You followed a certain set of rules that pertained to all three of those different classes, even though there are different subjects. But then, there were certain rules that pertained just to mathematics, certain rules that you followed because a particular teacher was strict-- not because of the topic they were covering-- as well as certain rules that maybe you did not pay attention to because a different teacher was a little more lax. For instance, maybe there was a teacher that let you put your feet up on the chair in front of you. Maybe, another teacher forbid that at all costs. The point being that your prefrontal cortex is the area of your brain that, along with other areas of your brain, ensures that you engage in context-specific behavior, context-specific thinking and context-specific understanding about what you should and should not do.

Task switching is somewhat distinct from cognitive flexibility. First of all task, switching requires cognitive flexibility, but they are not the same thing. Now, when we talk about task switching-- or rather, when you see task switching in the scientific literature-- most often, it has to do with people performing one particular type of mental or physical operation. Say, they're maneuvering things with their hands or other parts of their body, or they are required to carry out one specific type of mental process. And then, they are required, either at random intervals or at specific intervals-- maybe every 10 minutes or so-- to switch their attention and to do a different task entirely.

People are going to do one cognitive task, maybe mathematics, or they're going to count, for instance, from 1 up to infinity, as high as they can go in a given amount of time, in increments of say, 7 or increments of 7 plus 1 then 7 minus 1. These can be made increasingly difficult. You get the idea. And then perhaps, a tone is played or they'll get a signal from the experimenter. They need to switch their task to doing something quite different, but also cognitive. That's the most typical arrangement. Another typical arrangement in a task switching experiment is that the person in the task switching experiment will be asked to do some sort of physical manipulation of objects, maybe placement of puzzle pieces into the correct configuration. Then at some designated interval or intervals, they will have to switch to a different manual task. Fewer-- not zero, but fewer-- experiments have examined task switching between physical and cognitive tasks. There are these kind of outrageous examples that you can find on the internet. By the way, I don't suggest that anyone go engage in these examples in real life of extreme task switching. One of the most notable ones would be chess boxing. Believe it or not, this exists, where two people will enter a ring. They will sit down at a table. They will play chess for a given period of time. They're entirely focused on playing chess. Then a buzzer will go off. The chess table will be cleared. The chairs will be cleared. They will be expected to box, literally fight, for a round of a minute to three minutes, and then, go back to chess, then to boxing, so-called chess boxing. Again, I'm not suggesting people chess box. But I know that many people have challenges with task switching. Here, I can raise my hand and say that I am one such person.

I, like everybody else, take a little bit of time to get into a book chapter or to get into a mode of physical exercise. But once I'm doing something, I tend to be very focused on that. I have a much greater challenge in switching out of that focused mode to doing the next thing, which is one of the reasons why oftentimes, I run tardy, because I'm still mentally thinking about or physically engaged in the thing that I was doing before. This is something I'm constantly working on. As a consequence, I've had to seek out and implement certain tools to improve my ability to task switch. I'm going to share a few of those tools with you now, because I know a number of people probably struggle with the same thing. As I mentioned earlier, I'm also going to do a full-length episode about task switching, both the underlying mechanisms of task switching as well as a more extensive list of tools related to task switching, as a full-length Huberman Lab podcast episode. How can we get better at task switching? Short of having somebody scruff you by the neck and force you to stop whatever activity you're doing and engage in the next activity that you're doing, one of the best things that we can do to support our ability to task switch-- that's nicely supported both at the mechanistic level and at the practical level within the published literature-- is to introduce short transition gaps between the activities that we're trying to switch between. This is something that, in my opinion,",

                "transcript": "This is something that, in my opinion, has not been discussed enough. In fact, when was the last time you heard about the requirement for introducing gaps between tasks if you want to switch between them more efficiently? And yet, as a consequence of this not being discussed very often, I think a lot of people have placed an undue burden on themselves. For instance, a lot of people think that when you sit down with a book and you're going to read, that you should be able to immediately focus on the material that you're reading and not have your mind flitting about. During the first five, maybe even 10 minutes of reading a book chapter, unless you are absolutely enthralled from the first word, or you are intensely curious what the material in that book chapter is-- maybe that book chapter is about you and what's going to happen to you next in your life. Maybe the news article is about something that you care oh so much about. But unless it's one of those specific instances, it's going to be about five or 10 minutes before the neural circuits in your brain that are required to understand and digest and commit that material to memory are going to come online at the levels of activity that are going to be required for you to experience that as intense focus, or even as mild focus. The activity of the brain is always going to be in a push-pull. This is extremely important for understanding task switching. When you go from one task-- and maybe the task was simply to walk over to where the book is located-- to focusing on the material within that book, you have to both engage activity within certain neural circuits and you need to disengage the activity of other neural circuits. Sometimes, this is referred to as inhibition of certain neural circuits. Other times, it's just going to be a dissipation of activity of those neural circuits. They're just going to quiet down, like a dimming of the lights in a particular room, while the activity of other neural circuits increases. The first thing that you really need to understand, if you want to get better at task switching, is that you cannot and you should not expect yourself to immediately drop into a narrow trench of focus, or a narrow trench of ability, for anything that you're not already extremely skilled at or extremely interested in knowing. One of the reasons why this is often overlooked is that, for instance, if we receive a text message from somebody and we are very interested in what's contained in that text message, maybe even eagerly anticipating the dot, dot, dot in that little window where the text message is going to arrive-- like here it comes. Here it comes. Here it comes. It's an example of where you are able to immediately pay attention and absorb information. For instance, if you're trying to meet somebody in a big city, and you need to know exactly where to meet them, and you've arrived at the place where you thought you need to be and then, you can't find them. You're waiting. Where are you? Where are you? You're going to commit that information to memory and you're going to act on it. But when you sit down to read a book of unknown content, or where you have just a general sense of what the content is, or when you sit down to do something like work on a spreadsheet or your taxes, or engage in a conversation with somebody, expect a five to 10 minute transition period. I can't emphasize this enough, because I think a lot of people",

Perhaps indeed, they have clinically diagnosable attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or some other form of attention deficit disorder. I certainly can't rule that out based on this conversation alone. But a lot of people place this unfair burden on themselves to immediately be able to focus on a given task. This is also true for physical tasks. If you go to the gym to work out or you're heading out on a run or a cycling expedition, the idea that you would immediately be able to cycle at your peak performance, or that you could perform sets and reps in the gym as best as you possibly could without any warm-up, without any transition period, that you could forget about the difficult or maybe even great conversation that you were having on the way in, or that you could forget about other activities that you need to do in the rest of your day, that's just completely unfair. It doesn't match at all the way that your neural circuits work. You really need to match your expectation of your ability to focus on and perform a given task, whether or not it's cognitive or physical, to the actual underlying biology. That's the first point. The second point is that we know that if you want to switch from",

This I find fascinating, because what this means is that there are top down influences. There are literally things that we can tell ourselves, based on an understanding of the underlying mechanisms, that allow us to task switch better. This certainly doesn't involve taking any kind of prescription drug or supplement or doing anything differently, except as you go from task A to task B, knowing and designating that a transition period, even a very brief one where you are not trying to perform task B and that you've designated this as a transition period. I'm not trying to focus on the next thing that I need to do. I might focus on it inadvertently, but I'm not deliberately trying to focus on it. Rather, I'm going to think about what I just did and the fact that I'm no longer doing that, kind of leaving it like a fog behind. You're trying to move from this deep trench of attention, hopefully on task A-- or maybe, you didn't achieve a deep trench of attention-- and you're now done with task A. You're not placing this unfair expectation on your neural circuits to just flip to task B. You're also acknowledging that task B is going to take five to 10 minutes to drop into fully. We already talked about that. But you're going to shorten that five to 10 minutes by deliberately introducing a transition period. What comes in that transition period and its duration",

                "transcript": "What comes in that transition period and its duration is important. First, let's deal with the duration. How long should the transition period be? That is going to scale directly with how long you are in a deep trench of focus for task A. Let's assume task A was something that was kind of light for you. Maybe, you're just handling some email. Maybe, you're talking to a coworker. Maybe, you were at a board meeting and it was kind of light. The stuff was just OK. You're used to this stuff. This is stuff that you do all the time. Now, you're headed back to your desk or you're headed to your next class. Or perhaps, you did a workout that morning and now, you're going to head to your place of work. Or maybe, you're leaving work and you're going to engage with family. You know need to switch all these cognitive operations. You need to dump the stuff that you were just doing cognitively, and you now need to do a bunch of other things. Context is switching. Task is switching. Just ask yourself, how deeply was I entrenched in that other activity? Was my mind flitting to other things? If I was in a deep trench of attention for that given thing, then you should give yourself slightly longer for this transition period, maybe five or even 10 minutes if you have that time. Even if you give yourself as short as 60 to 90 seconds of transition and you just designate it as transition, you're going to benefit in terms of your ability to do the next task. To be very clear, if you were in kind of a light task or something that didn't have much cognitive demand, then the transition period can be fairly short. It can be just a couple of minutes. Rather, if you were in a deep trench of attention, you really engaged in that first task, I suggest giving yourself a couple of minutes or more, maybe as much as five to 10 minutes. But you might not have that much time. In which case, give yourself any kind of transition, even if it's 10 seconds. I certainly have had times in my life, in particular when I was a new assistant professor before I got tenure, where I remember sitting down to work on a grant. I'd get two lines out. Someone would knock on the door. Hey, where are the whatever, the 30 mil syringes? Where do we keep the buffers? Did we get this thing in? And then, I'd have to shift my attention and go back to writing. I'd be distracted by something else again. Which is not to say that people were distracting me unfairly. It was simply the case that, at that time, my life required being involved in a lot more things than it did as my career progressed, at least in the short term. The point being that if you are deeply engaged in an activity, give yourself a little bit longer in the transition period between them. If you are sort of superficially involved in an activity, you need less of a transition period. But you need a transition period. What should come during that transition period?",

                "transcript": "What should come during that transition period? The most important thing to arrive in that transition period is a relative lack of attention to anything new. This is what's so destructive about the phone. Keep in mind, I am not one of these people that thinks that smartphones are terrible. In fact, I use mine plural, very often, all day, often. Not necessarily during deep cognitive focus, but in between those bouts of focus, I have to text message people. I do work on there. I'm on social media, so certainly not demonizing the smartphone. However, if you finish a given activity-- whether or not it's cognitive or physical activity-- and you are headed to something else that requires you do a new task, and that task requires significant amounts of attention and focus, then you would do very well to allow yourself a period of anywhere from two minutes to maybe, as long as 10 minutes-- I know this is going to be very hard for people-- but two minutes to as long as 10 minutes where you are not looking at your phone. You're not texting. You're not on social media. You're not foraging for anything. In fact, you're trying to limit the total amount of information that you're bringing into your nervous system. Now, you don't have to walk around with eyes closed and try and not hear and not see. Let's be practical, folks. That's impossible to do anyway. You can't shut down your brain while awake. You can go into states of deeper relaxation. There's a non-sleep deep rest, which we'll talk about in a little bit. But you can't shut off your brain deliberately, not in any healthy way that is. But by introducing these transition zones, or transition periods as we'll call them, of two to 10 minutes between different tasks, and making sure that within those transition periods, you are not bringing in new information-- again, another context and what are you really doing? You're ensuring that you're not going from task A to task B to task C. What we're talking about here is trying to limit your task switching between task A and task B and not introducing another task in between. You might think that looking at your phone is not a task. It's so easy. It's so reflexive. But it is. It's bringing in a lot of new context, in particular pictures and movies which are tremendous stimulus for the nervous system and anchoring your attention. It's bringing in new ideas, new thoughts that no matter how hard you try, are going to intrude into your ability to perform task B. When people say, how do I get better at task switching, I immediately want to say, please don't introduce yet more tasks. Switching from one task to another is hard enough already. Don't introduce another task in between. Some of you might take this to mean that you shouldn't have a conversation with a coworker after a meeting while walking down the hall. I'm not saying that. I still encourage people to be social.",

                "transcript": "I still encourage people to be social. I encourage people to engage in workplace environments. However, I will say, after many years of working in laboratories that at times were quite large, if you walk into the lab and there are a lot of different things going on, one of the things that you learn how to do, if you're going to get good at your craft, is to not pay attention to what's going on with everyone crowded around a computer looking at who's winning at the World Cup. I'm not trying to insult soccer players here. I enjoy soccer, both playing it and observing it. But one has to scruff themselves a little bit in trying to limit their attention to a number of different things in the environment, and really go from task A to task B in a really dedicated way. Short lists benefit certain people. I know a lot of people are list makers out there. They like to put two or three things, or maybe 20 things that they're going to accomplish each day. One of the best tools that I ever learned, both for the sake of task switching but also for sake of just getting things done on a consistent basis-- I picked up while I was a master's student at Berkeley-- a very accomplished professor at that time told me that he writes down every day three things that he's going to accomplish and only three things, never more than three. He also included other activities. In fact, he was quite active in his physical life. He rode his bike to campus. He also was a runner. He also went to the gym. He did not include those on his list of three things. He would write down no more than three critical things to do each day. He had three critical tasks. I've employed that method as well. I'll write down one, sometimes two, most often three, but if I can, just one or two tasks that I need to complete each day. Everything else is considered part of the, let's just say, automaticity function of my day, things that I already know how to do. They don't require a ton of cognitive focus. But I limit the things that require a lot of cognitive focus to three things per day. However, those three things per day can take up many, many hours each and certainly, on the whole. There are additional things that one can do to improve your ability to task switch. One of the things that I found particularly beneficial is not a meditation, but rather, is a perceptual exercise. This is a perceptual exercise that I learned about when I was a graduate student, but in a totally different context. It has to do with the way that your visual system and the parts of your brain that parse time are related to one another and influence one another. The reason this tool makes sense for improving your ability to task switch is because it turns out that where you focus your visual attention strongly influences the way that your brain parses time. I'll describe the tool first. And then, I'll get a little bit into the underlying mechanisms. Again, I'll get deep into the underlying mechanisms, as well as the tool, as well as additional tools, in a future episode about task switching on the Huberman Lab podcast. If you were to, for instance, close your eyes and not look at anything in your external environment and just concentrate, for instance, on your breathing or the feeling on the surface of your skin-- I know this is starting to sound like meditation, but trust me, it's not meditation-- your perception of time, that is, how finely you are slicing time, would be distinctly different than if you were to open your eyes and focus on a faraway location, say way off in the horizon, and not focus on your bodily sensations. Similarly, if you were to focus your attention on some intermediate location, maybe, let's say, 20 feet away and simultaneously, focus on your internal bodily sensations or the surface of your skin, your perception of time how quickly time was passing would also be different than if you closed your eyes or if you were looking at some distant location. The perceptual tool for task switching is a very simple one. It's one that frankly, I do every morning and have for many years now and at least, for me, has really enhanced my ability to task switch. That is, just take a couple of minutes.",

I should mention, I typically do this in an environment where ideally, I can see off into the distance, perhaps from a balcony if I'm in an apartment or a house, ideally outdoors. But if I'm indoors, I'll still do this. I'll just look as far off into the distance as I can when that step is required. I start off by closing my eyes and essentially not looking at anything, but directing my brain's focus to either the surface of my body, just what it feels like, what it's in contact with or not in contact with, maybe my breathing. Then, I'll open my eyes and I will focus on some location on my body but my bodily surface, like my hand at some distance. I'll focus my attention there maybe for just five to 15 seconds. I should mention that the first station, as I call them, where my eyes were closed and I was focusing on my bodily sensations, I also just do that for about five to 15 seconds. I don't count specifically, just roughly five to 15 seconds. Second station, you're looking at the surface of your hand. If you like, you can also concentrate on your breathing. But typically, people will just focus on some specific location on their hand. Then, I'll typically lower my hand. Then, I'll look off into the distance, maybe five to 10 feet. It doesn't really matter. Focus my visual attention there. Try and hold that focus for five to 15 seconds. Then, I'll look further off in the distance, maybe, further still off into the distance. Ultimately, what I try and do is look at a location as far off into the distance as I possibly can. I'm also trying to pay attention to my breathing at the same time, just as a way of calibrating my location to the location that I'm looking at and how great that is. Then typically, I'll close my eyes and return my attention to my immediate environment and my breathing just in the location I'm in. The entire thing only takes about two minutes. Again, starting with eyes closed, focusing on self five to 15 seconds. Then, eyes open, focusing on surface of one's body, that is, focusing one's visual attention five to 15 seconds maybe 10 feet away, then maybe, 50 feet away. If you're in the metric system, meters works just as well. These distances do not have to be precise. And then, off to the horizon and then, back to one's immediate location by closing one's eyes.

                "transcript": "What is happening when one does this perceptual exercise? Again, it's a perceptual exercise. It's a visual perceptual exercise. What's happening is, you are shifting your visual focus, obviously. But you're also shifting the way in which you fine slice or thick slice time. Your ability to recognize, consciously, whether or not your thin slicing or thick slicing time is much harder to get a grasp of than it is to get a grasp of whether or not you're looking at your hand or off in the distance. That's kind of obvious. But what we know for sure is that as you shift your attention from your immediate environment out to different designated locations in your environment, and your time perception shifts accordingly, you're essentially training your brain to shift visual focus and the way in which you process in the time domain. This is important in the context of task switching, because so much of task switching is not just to understand OK, I'm going from reading to running or from running to reading and the different types of operations that are required in one case versus the other, but also, a shift in the neural circuits that underlie your perception of time. Again, this is a topic that deserves a much more elaborate discussion. So much of our ability to execute a task with high proficiency has to do with getting our thinking and our actions into the correct time domain. When I say time domain, I know a number of people can get confused because time is time. People think, what do you mean by time domain? Space domain makes sense. Here, I'm not talking about outer space, whether or not you're looking in one location or another close to your body or far away from your body are different domains of space. But the time domain is a little trickier for most people to understand. Just think of it this way. When you see a slow motion movie, what you're seeing is a movie that was shot at a high frame rate, many frames per second. The typical smartphone shoots movies at about 60 frames per second, some older ones, 30 frames per second. The slow-mo function on your smartphone is actually a high frame rate function. You took the same movie, but you took it at a higher frame rate. You've got a lot more images. Therefore, you can generate slow motion. With your visual system, when you focus very close in to your body or you're focused on bodily sensations in your immediate environment, you are fine slicing in the time domain more so than when you are looking further off in the distance. Similarly, when you engage in one type of task, like a board meeting or a Zoom meeting or a conversation with friends, you are in a very different set of neural circuit functions than when you sit down to read or learn math or lift weights or go to therapy or go for a walk with your dog, for instance. Now, it should be clear why when you move from task to task you want to A, introduce a transition period. It can be very brief. Maybe, you don't even have time for the two minute transition",

                "transcript": "Maybe, you don't even have time for the two minute transition period. You just say, OK. I'm in a transition period between task A and task B. I'm moving from this thing to that thing. I just need like 10 seconds. I'm going to recognize. I'm going to count down 10 to one or one up to 10. It doesn't matter. This is transition time. But this is not a time to look at my phone or to be in lots of different time domains. You might say, well, does that mean I shouldn't look at the horizon while I'm walking from my meeting back to my desk? No. That's not the way that your brain works. It doesn't anchor to things that just happen to be in your environment unless they're of particular interest. What I'm saying is, set a transition period between tasks ideally, two maybe as long as 10 minutes. I'm also saying that when you switch between tasks, or when you initiate your first major task of the day, please expect-- do expect-- a period in which it's hard to get into the groove, so to speak. In addition to that, I recommend having some of practice. I described the practice that I've used for some period of time now, at least for me to great success, where you are deliberately shifting your visual attention between different locations close to you and far away. You're doing that as a perceptual practice. Again, the whole thing only takes about two minutes, maybe three minutes. You don't even need to do it every day. I happen to do it every day, but I miss the occasional day here and there. Even if you were to do this perceptual practice once a week or three times a week, I'm certain that you'll benefit. Because in doing that perceptual practice, there's also an immediate recognition of the sorts of shifts that your brain is required to engage in any time you move from task A to task B or from task B to task C. You start to see and feel, literally see and feel, the way that transition occurs. It takes a little bit of time. But you can accelerate that transition if you understand that oh, when I'm looking here and engaging in this type of behavior or sets of tasks and then, I'm now going to be expected to do another task in a completely different type of environment, the brain is going to be required to shift over the neural circuits that are active and less active in order to do that. You can accelerate that process by practicing it using that perceptual tool that I described. There, I covered some specific tools that one can use to enhance one's ability to task switch, touching on a bit of the underlying neurobiology and why transition periods are useful, if not required. If you think about there's always a transition period when task switching, but here, you're taking conscious control over that transition period. There are additional tools for enhancing one's ability to task switch. They tend to be somewhat specific for the certain kinds of cognitive or physical tasks that one needs to do. The example of chess boxing that I gave earlier, a great example of task switching at its extreme, terrible example of a practice space-time bridging. Very safe, I can't think of any way in which it might be dangerous, although please don't do it while driving or while operating any other machinery. By all accounts, very safe, zero cost. We talked about some of the other tools for task switching as well. Thank you for joining for the beginning of this Ask Me Anything episode. To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these Ask Me Anything sessions, plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the Huberman Lab podcast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. Just to remind you why we launched the Huberman Lab podcast Premium channel, it's really twofold. First of all, it's to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which of course, will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length. We are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast, and to fund research, in particular, research done on human beings. Not animal models, but on human beings, which I think we all agree, is a species that we are most interested in. We are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance. Those protocols will be distributed through all channels, not just the premium channel, but through all channels, Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. The idea here is to give you information to your burning questions, in depth, and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the Tiny Foundation has generously offered to do a dollar-for-dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel. This is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel, to further support research for science and science-related tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to sign up for the Huberman Lab Premium channel, again, there's a cost of $10 per month. Or you can pay $100 up front for the entire year. That will give you access to all the AMAs. You can ask questions and get answers to your questions. You'll of course get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well. There will also be some premium content, such as transcripts of the AMAs and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman Lab Podcast episodes not found elsewhere. Again, you'll be supporting research for mental health, physical health, and performance. You can sign up for the premium channel by going to hubermanlab.com/premium. Again, that's hubermanlab.com/premium. As always, thank you for your interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]",

The question specifically is, and I quote, \"there seems to be a lot of conjecture about resveratrol and whether or not it can extend lifespan. Could you please tell us your thoughts on this subject?\" OK, well, I will indeed tell you my thoughts on this subject. And I'll use it as an opportunity to also give you my thoughts about supplementation for sake of longevity, that is, for extending lifespan, more generally. So resveratrol got a lot of attention some years back because, at the time, it was believed that supplementing with resveratrol could impact certain cellular pathways that would extend not just the lifespan of those individual cells but perhaps the lifespan of the entire organism, meaning us, humans. And as a consequence, supplements such as resveratrol supplements but also grape seed extracts, which we know contain a fair amount of resveratrol or can be converted into resveratrol, also received a lot of attention for their potential to increase lifespan. I think by now, 2023, it's fair to say that most of that thinking has been, let's just say, debunked. I think that most people understand that while indeed resveratrol might have some positive effects on the functioning of our cells that there is very little, if any, direct evidence that resveratrol can increase lifespan. If you are aware of any data to the contrary that is modern, is highly controlled, and even better, was carried out in human studies or non-human primate studies or even mouse studies, please put links to those in the comments on YouTube, because I'd love to see those studies, especially recent studies. But my current line of thinking is that resveratrol while it may have certain health benefits does not seem to increase lifespan. Now, with that said, that doesn't",

In fact, I take 400 to 800 milligrams of grape seed extract, usually with a meal. It's just part of my standard supplementation stack every single day. But I do that mainly for its effects on vascular function and blood flow and a few other effects that grape seed extract has been related to. The data there, I would say, are reasonably strong, strong enough certainly that when weighed against the potential downsides of taking grape seed extract, including the cost of grape seed extract, lead me to take 400 to 800 milligrams grape seed extract per day. I just do that as a kind of general insurance policy against a number of things. And it's part of a small kit of supplements that I take that fall into that category, meaning supplements that appear to be very safe, certainly at the dosages that I just referred to, supplements that potentially are having positive effects on our cells, and that are fairly if not very low cost. So that's why I take grape seed extract. I do not take it for its potential impact on resveratrol and resveratrol-related pathways per se and certainly not to extend my lifespan.

My answer was I don't think it extends lifespan. But I take something related to resveratrol for other health purposes. And by the way, I certainly wouldn't place grape seed extract in my list of top five or even top 10 supplements if somebody, for instance, said I want to take anywhere from one to 10 supplements, and I have x amount of budget to devote to supplementation. And I'm thinking about taking grape seed extract. Would that be one of the top 10 supplements you would recommend? I certainly wouldn't put it in the top 10. And by the way, at some point in the not too distant future, I will put online-- so I'll probably do a podcast episode-- listing out all the supplements that I take and the rationale behind those and how long I've taken them and the effects that I've observed both subjectively and in my blood work and what I recommend to other people, what I don't recommend to other people, what's specific to me, and so on and so forth.

                "transcript": "Now, with that said, let's use this as an opportunity to talk about some of the other so-called longevity supplements and drugs that are often discussed online and elsewhere in terms of their efficacy to increase lifespan. About four or five years ago, there was a sudden and increased attention on NAD-related pathways for increasing longevity. So the NAD pathway, as some of you may already know, is a pathway within all of our cells. This is a pathway that is highly active in young animals and humans. But all animals and humans across the entire lifespan make NAD in their cells. It's related to cellular energetics. That is the production of energy in cells. It has direct relevance to mitochondrial function and mitochondrial function to it. And that's a discussion unto itself. But suffice it to say that the pathway leading to NAD includes things such as NR and NMN. NR and NMN are considered by many to be precursors to NAD. OK, so why am I telling you all these acronyms? Here's the deal. The argument was made, in fact, by some prior guests on the Huberman Lab podcast and elsewhere that by increasing NAD levels in our cells that one could potentially extend lifespan. And there are generally three ways in which people have attempted to do that. OK, we'll talk about whether or not increasing NAD in our cells actually increases lifespan in a moment. But for the time being, let's just talk about some of the ways that people have tried to increase NAD within their brain and body. The most typical ways that people have done that is through, until very recently, supplementation. And so there are supplements out there such as NR which we know can increase NAD levels. So this is taken as a pill or a powder, typically as a capsule or a powder. Or by taking NMN which, and here there's been some, let's just say, debate as to whether or not taking NMN actually leads to increases in NAD within our cells, whether or not it can get into our cells, whether or not it's converted into NAD, and so on and so on. But there again, the idea was by taking NAD either in capsule form, or it's sometimes taken as a sublingual powder, that one could increase NAD levels and thereby potentially increase lifespan. And then there's a third way that's commonly used to try and increase NAD levels, and that's by infusing by intravenous infusion, or in some cases, by oral administration, either liquid or pill form, NAD itself. Now, I confess that I have tried all three of these approaches. OK, so I do indeed take an NR supplement every day.",

                "transcript": "OK, so I do indeed take an NR supplement every day. I take 500 milligrams of NR. I also and have separately taken an NMN supplement. I take sublingual NMN. So I'll take anywhere from 1 to 2 grams of NMN as a sublingual powder, which as the name suggests, you put it under your tongue, and it dissolves there. It's got this kind of tangy flavor. And the goal for me in taking an NR and NMN each day-- and I should mention that sometimes I have just taken NMN or just NR to do the comparison between NR and NMN for me in a subjective way, just comparing what are my energy levels, how do I feel, whether or not there are any side effects. And then I've also taken them together. And I've arrived at a protocol where I take NR and NMN every single day. And the goal of that is indeed to increase NAD levels within my system. However, and I really want to emphasize this, I do not take NR and NMN in order to increase my lifespan. In fact, at this point in history, it's unclear and seems somewhat unlikely that increasing NAD is going to increase lifespan. But I think we should always keep our minds open. There may be data to arrive in the future that shows that actually does happen in humans. Now, there are some animal data suggesting that increasing NAD either by taking NR and/or NMN can increase lifespan. But frankly, that is not why I take NR and NMN. I take NR and NMN in an effort to increase NAD. And now I realize what I'm about to say is entirely subjective. And I really want to highlight that. What I'm about to describe is my experience. It is not based on any peer-reviewed studies. When I take NR and NMN at the dosages I talked about a little bit earlier, it gives me a lot of sustained mental and physical energy throughout the day. Now, I've always had a lot of mental and physical energy. But I'm 48 years old now. And I'm interested in doing anything that I safely can to keep those levels of energy as high as is reasonable, right? I don't want to have so much energy that I can't sit still or so much energy that I can't sleep at night. But I find that when I take NR and NMN in the morning-- so typically, I'll do this before my first meal. I don't really regulate how close it is to that first meal. So I'll wake up, use the bathroom, hydrate, get my sunlight, do all the things I've talked about on other podcasts. But I'll take my NR and NMN sometime usually within about an hour or two of waking up and typically at least 30 minutes to two hours before my first meal, which for me usually arrives around 11:00 a.m. So sometimes I'll take it long before my first meal. In any event, it gives me a lot of energy. And I seem to have that energy throughout the day. I have gone periods of time where I stopped taking NR and/or NMN. And while I didn't feel as if I was completely depleted of energy, I did notice a decrement in energy compared to when I took NR and NMN. Now, I want to be very, very clear. I have no, zero, financial relationship to any company that manufactures NR. And while I used to have a relationship to a company that made NMN, as of recently, there's an FDA ruling that has made NMN not available as a supplement in the wider world. So earlier this year-- that is in 2023--",

                "desc": "Experience with NAD infusions, their discomfort, and the subjective benefits observed post-infusion.",
                "transcript": "So earlier this year-- that is in 2023-- there was a filing for NMN as a experimental drug in a clinical trial. And as a consequence, NMN was listed as a banned or not allowed to be commercially sold supplement. And that has to do with some of the legality around clinical trials. And when something is listed as an experimental drug, it can't be listed as a supplement. Nonetheless, you can still find NMN on the open market. You can find it on Amazon. I can't really speak to the purity of one source versus another. You'll have to explore that on your own. But I will say this, even though I said it before. I have zero financial relationship to any company that manufactures and sells NMN at this time or NR at this time. So the short summary to this whole discussion about NR and NMN is that I take NR and NMN, but I take it because I like how it makes me feel. It increases my energy levels in the morning and throughout the day. And it does so in a way that tapers off nicely in the evening, and I can still fall asleep, et cetera. I do not take it with any expectation that it's going to increase my lifespan, simply because I don't think the data substantiating the extension and lifespan are here yet. They may arrive at some point. But I don't think that they are here yet. So there are a good number of people out there that still take NR and/or NMN and are doing so in efforts to increase NAD. And so let's take a moment and talk about increasing NAD directly, because that's something that I have some recent experience with, and that's becoming more common and is, yes, still FDA approved, at least as far as I know. There are companies that can come to your house, or you can go to a facility, and they will give you an NAD infusion. So they will infuse you directly with NAD into the vein. I've done this twice now. And I will say, as most people experience when they do an NAD infusion, it's pretty darn uncomfortable. In fact, so much so that a lot of people have to take anti-nausea meds in order to get the NAD infusion. I opted to not take the anti-nausea meds, not because I'm particularly tough, but because I don't like taking additional medication if I can. But I've taken anywhere from 500 to 1,000 milligrams of NAD by infusion. I did that at times when I was feeling particularly rundown or post-illness. And I did indeed find that after the NAD infusion was complete, I felt much, much better in a number of different ways-- improved sleep, improved vigor, coming off those illnesses. I felt much better. But again, there is no clinical trial exploring NAD infusion for sake of vigor, et cetera, that I am aware of. I just happen to be somebody who is interested in exploring these tools and techniques from time to time. And I deemed this as safe. Whether or not it's safe for you, you have to explore with your physician. Also, I do want to reemphasize what I said a moment ago. Those NAD infusions are pretty darn uncomfortable. You can have the person administering the infusion adjust the rate of the infusion so that the drip is slower, which makes it more tolerable as opposed to trying to get the whole infusion bag in there in 45 minutes or less. I just wanted to get the whole thing over with. So I just said, put it in as quickly as you reasonably and safely can. It took about an hour, maybe 45 minutes to an hour. Initially, I felt nauseous. I felt like someone was stepping on my chest. I felt like someone was stepping on my legs. I felt like, well, I just felt lousy. I felt so awful. And then after about 10 minutes, it passed. And I felt fine. And then after the infusion was done, as I mentioned before, I felt terrific. I was still able to fall asleep that night just fine,",

I have heard of some people doing NAD infusions later in the day and having challenges with sleep. But again, that's just anecdotal. Or we could call it anecdata, if you want, but it's anecdotal. It's generally assumed for obvious reasons that NAD infusions are more effective at increasing cellular levels of NAD than NR or NMN or both together, although the direct comparison has not been made, as far as I know. And there's still this general question as to whether or not any of this stuff is getting into cells directly and impacting NAD levels in specific cells, although I think most people assume that the NAD infusions certainly are. Now, there are a number of different experts out there who debate all the fine points of everything that I just said, people like Dr. Charles Brenner and people like Dr. David Sinclair, people like Matt Kaeberlein. There are people who really actively, and let's just say, heatedly debate all the issues that I just talked about. I think the greatest debate is around whether or not increasing NAD levels in cells actually increases lifespan. But there's also a debate around whether or not NR is more advantageous than NMN, whether or not all of this is too premature to explore yet already. Again, I just want to restate for the third time. I don't do any of this stuff in these NAD pathways for sake of increasing lifespan. I do it for sake of the vitality and energy effects that I subjectively experience. I must say that the NAD infusions are expensive enough, inconvenient enough, and let's just say uncomfortable enough that I don't see myself doing them very often, although perhaps maybe doing them a couple of times a year or more makes sense should I find myself feeling run down or post-illness fatigue or things of that sort. I would be very curious to learn from any of you, the audience, what sorts of things you've experienced if perhaps you've explored NR supplementation, NMN supplementation, or NAD infusions. And as I mentioned earlier, there's now a growing number of different products that claim that you can take NAD orally, so either in pill, tincture or other forms, so no requirement for an infusion. But I'm not aware of any studies that have directly linked oral NAD to NAD levels in cells and how those two things relate. So lots more important science to be done in this area, lots more debate surely to be had, and any time we talk about supplements, I just want to emphasize several times that I do see supplements as indeed supplements.

                "transcript": "I think only by getting your light exposure, sunshine, movement, nutrition, stress modulation, social relationships, et cetera, correct should you even begin to consider supplementation, because supplementation is just not at the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance. It is indeed something that, provided it fits within your safety and economic frameworks, could potentially enhance mental health, physical health, performance in certain ways. But it's certainly not the foundation from which you build mental health, physical health, and performance. So now we've talked about resveratrol, a little bit about grape seed extract. We've talked about NR and NMN and NAD and the NAD pathway. There are a few other things that are commonly discussed in the longevity sphere, let's call it, things such as metformin. I'll just be very direct and say I do not take metformin. And I also don't take what some people call the poor man's version of metformin, which is berberine. Berberine gives me brutal headaches. Berberine lowers blood glucose. That's why I think it's giving me brutal headaches. A lot of people have explored or are thinking about exploring taking metformin or berberine for sake of lowering blood glucose and lowering a particular cellular, let's just say, pathway or a set of molecules, mTOR being the most common of them. mTOR, mammalian Target of Rapamycin, is abundant in developing cells. It's responsible for the growth of individual cells. And the amount of mTOR in our cells tapers off across our lifespan. mTOR and its pathways is something that I've actually worked on fairly extensively in my laboratory in the context of the regeneration of the visual system. So I'm very familiar with it. And for sake of convenience and ease in this conversation, we can just think of mTOR as something that's abundant in cells during development and any time cells are growing, including the growth of tumor cells, and cellular growth at any stage of the lifespan. So the logic that people have waged is that drugs like metformin or compounds like berberine that reduce mTOR levels or impact the mTOR pathway in ways that lead to net decreases in mTOR, the logic is that could somehow increase lifespan. There's also the logic that fasting can reduce mTOR which can increase lifespan. I don't think there's any direct evidence for that yet, however, at least not in humans. So I'll tell you. I don't take berberine for the reasons I mentioned before. It makes me feel uncomfortable. Not psychologically uncomfortable, it makes me feel physically uncomfortable. I don't take metformin because expert colleagues of mine, including Dr. Peter Attia, have come on this podcast. In fact, we did a collaboration journal club podcast that we'll provide a link to in the show note captions during which we, meaning mainly Peter, reviewed the peer-reviewed data on metformin and lifespan. And at least to my understanding, at present, there isn't sufficient data to support taking metformin for increasing lifespan. So that's why I don't take it. I may in the future if more data come out and things change. But right now, I see no reason to take metformin to increase my lifespan. So I don't take metformin.",

                "transcript": "So I don't take metformin. Similarly, there's a lot of discussion out there about rapamycin. Remember mTOR, mammalian Target of Rapamycin, is so named because it's a target of this drug, which is used largely as an anticancer drug but has other purposes as well. Rapamycin is actively under investigation, which makes it sound like there was a crime committed. But as far as I know, there wasn't. Under active scientific exploration would be the more accurate way to say it, by excellent researchers such as Dr. Matt Kaeberlein up at the University of Washington in Seattle. He's been looking at rapamycin for its ability to extend lifespan, focusing on many different species, including dogs. So he has a dog longevity project. So that's really interesting. Dr. Peter Attia has talked a lot about rapamycin and did a recent podcast about rapamycin with not only Matt Kaeberlein but one of the experts in the world on mTOR. So I invite you to check out that podcast if you want to learn about rapamycin. So there is a fair amount of understanding about the biological pathways of rapamycin and mTOR and so on. And there are clinician physicians, like Peter as well as others, who are quite excited about the potential for rapamycin to extend lifespan, although you have to go directly to Peter to find out exactly what he's doing, whether or not he's taking rapamycin or not. I certainly can't speak for him. But at present, I don't take rapamycin. Why don't I take rapamycin? Well, I don't take rapamycin because at least to my eye, the data at present don't justify that for sake of increasing lifespan. That is not to say that rapamycin isn't an effective drug for the treatment of various cancers and for other purposes. But for me, at this point in time, I just don't see a good reason for me to take rapamycin relative to some of the, let's just say, substantiated potential side effects of rapamycin. It is a drug that I think can be taken safely under certain conditions but has enough of a side effect profile that I'm not interested in taking it for sake of increasing lifespan at this time. So no metformin, no rapamycin for me right now, perhaps in the future. I've listed out the things that I'm perfectly willing and happy to do, grape seed extract, NR and NMN, the occasional NAD infusion to increase NAD directly, and for the time being, I've decided to stay away from metformin and rapamycin. But of course, any and all of that could change going forward depending on the data that are published and my own experiences. As a final point on this, I want to again emphasize that the foundation of a quality life and a long life is most certainly going to come from the basics, perhaps the most fundamental and important of which is to get sufficient amounts of quality sleep each night. We know that not doing that can indeed reduce your lifespan if not directly, then certainly indirectly by increased number of accidents and certainly being far less happy and energetic during the day. So that's fundamental.",

                "transcript": "So that's fundamental. Also, and this is very important to emphasize-- and here I'm essentially borrowing the words straight out of Dr. Peter Attia's mouth. So forgive me, Peter. This won't be nearly as eloquent or succinct as Peter would make it. But it is very, very clear that at present there is no supplement or drug for increasing longevity that even comes close to the known improvements in health metrics that relate to longevity that come from getting quality sleep and especially from getting sufficient amounts of quality exercise. So that means both a combination of cardiovascular exercise, a minimum of 180 to 220 minutes of so-called zone 2 cardio per week. So that's cardio that you can carry out while still maintaining a conversation but should you increase the intensity any more, you would have a hard time completing your sentences. But in addition to that also doing some VO2 max work, so getting your heart rate way, way up at least once per week, and also, of course, doing resistance training either with weights, machines or bodyweight, doing that at sufficient intensity, six sets minimum per body part per week to maintain not just muscular size and strength but equally important, perhaps even more important, maintaining nerve to muscle connectivity, which correlates with cognitive function and a number of other important longevity metrics. So again exercise, sleep, quality nutrition, quality social connection, which means eliminating as best you can toxic social connection and increasing quality social connection, people that you like and enjoy spending time with and feel enriched by, stress modulation, all of these things are so key. And of course, getting morning sunlight, all of those things combine to have a huge out-sized effect compared to anything that you could take in pill, capsule or infusion. So before even considering taking any supplement or drug to increase your longevity or even for increasing vitality for that matter, get those basics of sleep, sunlight, nutrition, movement, stress modulation, or stress control, I should say, and relationships down. Get those right. And get that morning sunlight to set your circadian rhythm, because of course, your circadian rhythm is what anchors it all. And I'd be completely remiss if I didn't emphasize yet again that any time you're thinking of adding a supplement or removing a supplement from your regimen or adding a prescription drug or removing a prescription drug, you absolutely should consult you're board-certified physician. Thank you for joining for the beginning of this Ask Me Anything episode. To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these Ask Me Anything sessions plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the Huberman Lab podcast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. Just to remind you why we launched the Huberman Lab podcast premium channel, it's really twofold. First of all, it's to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which of course, will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length-- we are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast-- and to fund research, in particular research done on human beings, so not animal models but on human beings, which I think we all agree is a species that we are most interested in. And we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance. And those protocols will be distributed through all channels, not just the premium channel, but through all channels, Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. So the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the Tiny Foundation has generously offered to do a dollar-for-dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel. So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science-related tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to sign up for the Huberman Lab premium channel, again, there's a cost of $10 per month, or you can pay $100 up front for the entire year. That will give you access to all the AMAs. You can ask questions and get answers to your questions. And you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well. There will also be some premium content such as transcripts of the AMAs and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman Lab podcast episodes not found elsewhere. And again, you'll be supporting research for mental health, physical health, and performance. You can sign up for the premium channel by going to hubermanlab.com/premium.

This was a question that was asked by Jack Pritchard and they got a lot of up votes. Now, we've done multiple full-length episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast on sleep and tools to improve sleep, including the Master Your Sleep episode and Perfect Your Sleep episode, as well as a toolkit that is available completely zero cost at hubermanlab.com. It's a downloadable PDF that lists out the behavioral tools and other tools that you can implement to improve your sleep. Now Jack's question is specifically about how to improve deep sleep. He asks, I have a sleep analyzer and I typically observe that I get a lot of REM sleep, that is rapid eye movement sleep. For him, he says it's 30% of his total sleep is rapid eye movement sleep. But he asks, my deep sleep is often low, around 10%, and I would like to know if there are any science-backed protocols I can use to specifically increase my deep sleep. Okay, so for those of you that may not know what is deep sleep. Now, deep sleep is sometimes referred to as slow-wave sleep, that is slow-wave sleep and deep sleep are sometimes used interchangeably to describe the same thing. They aren't necessarily the same thing,",

Well, when you go to sleep at night, you cycle through a number of different stages of sleep. And in the early part of the night, I would say in the first half of your night or so, most of your sleep is going to be slow-wave deep sleep. But then as you transition into the second half of your night, more of your sleep will be rapid eye movement sleep. Now that's the typical pattern that is observed when you're not disrupting your sleep architecture with things like caffeine and alcohol. We'll talk about caffeine and alcohol in a few minutes. Deep sleep, aka slow-wave sleep,",

During deep sleep, you secrete growth hormone and in fact you secrete growth hormone every night when you go to sleep. But most of that growth hormone release is restricted to the first half of your sleep night. The other feature of deep sleep is that the dreams that occur during deep sleep tend to be of a less emotional nature than the sorts of dreams that one experiences in rapid eye movement sleep. So just to give a broad top contour of what deep sleep, aka slow-wave sleep is really about, it tends to occur in the first half of the night, it also occurs in the second half of the night, but in the first half of the night, most of your sleep is going to be occupied by deep sleep, aka slow-wave sleep.

                "transcript": "It is the time when your bodily tissues are repaired in part by release of growth hormone, which is involved in metabolism, but also protein synthesis, muscle repair, repair of all cell types and tissues. And during deep sleep, your dreams tend to be somewhat mundane, sometimes a little bizarre, but typically not very emotionally loaded. That can change if you're dealing with a lot of emotionally laden circumstances in your waking life, but in general, the sleep and dreams that occur in the first part of the night is deep and it's not terribly emotionally ridden. Your body also goes through specific patterns of metabolism. Now, this relates to recent findings just this last year in which researchers monitored the output of people's breath and the various metabolic factors present in the breath as well as through blood draws, So basically doing all this while people are asleep in a laboratory. And they observe that during the first half of the night while people are in deep sleep, their body is actually metabolizing energy very differently than it does in the second half of the night. I'll come back to this in a little while, but this turns out to be very important for establishing your metabolism and the way you regulate insulin and blood glucose during the daytime. So all of this is to say that getting sufficient deep sleep, slow-wave sleep, is vitally important. And Jack's asking how he can increase the amount of deep sleep that he's getting because by his sleep tracking method, he's observing far less deep sleep than rapid eye movement sleep. Now that raises the question of how much deep sleep one should be getting overall. In general, the goal should be to balance the total amount of slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep across the night. However, I would not want people to obsess over getting exactly 30% rapid eye movement sleep and exactly 30% slow-wave sleep. Your body is much more resilient than that, but the closer those two numbers are to one another, the better overall architecture of your sleep. And he doesn't list out exactly how he's measuring his sleep so I do want to put an asterisk on both the question and the answer I provide by stating that a lot of sleep trackers, whether or not they are WHOOP trackers or Ouras",

And that's because during rapid eye movement sleep, you tend to be in what's called atonia, you tend to be paralyzed, you can't move. And during slow-wave sleep, that's not the case. But no matter what the sleep tracking method is, if it's a standard commercial sleep tracking method, WHOOP or Eight Sleep, et cetera, it is an estimate or a best guess at what stage of sleep you're in. Whereas when you go into a sleep laboratory, like the sleep laboratory at Stanford, at University of Pennsylvania or other of the great sleep laboratories that are out there, they're going to use other methods including EEG and EMG. These are just acronyms that refer to ways to record brainwaves. They actually are going to try and observe for rapid eye movements beneath the eyelids, et cetera. So sleep trackers give you a best guess as to what stage of sleep you're in. They are not perfectly accurately, at least none of the commercially available sleep trackers are perfectly accurate. So we do want to highlight that. Okay, so now let's answer Jack's question directly,",

                "transcript": "Okay, so now let's answer Jack's question directly, which is how to increase the total amount of slow-wave sleep. Well, there are a couple ways. First of all are the don'ts and then we'll talk about the dos. Two things that you can do to really disrupt your slow-wave sleep are to drink alcohol within eight hours prior to bedtime or even at all. Some people will find that even if they have a glass of wine or a beer with lunch, that the amount of slow-wave sleep and sometimes even the rapid eye movement sleep that they get at night is reduced and that their overall sleep architecture is disrupted. This has been shown again and again. Likewise, avoiding caffeine within eight and ideally within 12 hours of bedtime would be preferable. And if you're not a caffeine drinker, obviously you don't have to worry about this at all, but avoiding caffeine intake within that 8 to 12 hours of bedtime will greatly assist in you getting more slow-wave sleep and higher quality rapid eye movement sleep. This has been shown again and again. And as well avoiding cannabis use and maybe even CBD use within 8 to 12 hours of sleep can be very beneficial if your goal is to improve the quality of your sleep. Now, I know a lot of people rely on alcohol, cannabis and CBD in order to get into sleep. However, it's been shown many times in human studies, and this was discussed in the podcast episode that we did with the great Matt Walker, who's a professor of neuroscience and psychology at University of California, Berkeley, and a world expert in sleep and sleep science. Matt and I discussed the research showing that even though alcohol helps you fall asleep, even though cannabis can help you fall asleep, and even though CBD can help people fall asleep, that it does disrupt and in many ways reduce the quality of sleep that one gets. So that's disappointing news I know for a number of the people that rely on cannabis, CBD, or alcohol to fall asleep, but I would encourage you to check out the episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast that we did about alcohol and about cannabis, including some of the health benefits of cannabis in certain situations, but also some of the detrimental effects of both alcohol and cannabis in other situations in particular for improving slow-wave sleep. So that's actually three major don'ts. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and cannabis, and let's put under the umbrella of cannabis, THC and CBD in the 8 and ideally within the 12 hours prior to sleep if your goal is to improve the total amount of slow-wave sleep that you're getting and your overall sleep architecture. In addition, it's well known that avoiding food intake in the two hours prior to sleep is going to greatly assist in the amount of growth hormone output that you achieve during the early stages of the night and the depth and duration of slow-wave sleep. Now, I want to place an asterisk on that statement",

                "transcript": "Now, I want to place an asterisk on that statement by saying if you go to sleep too hungry, it can also disrupt your sleep. So you're going to have to arrange your eating schedule and your sleeping schedule such that you're not eating too close to bedtime, but you're also not going to bed so hungry that you can't fall asleep or that you don't get into deep sleep and stay asleep. I can personally attest to the fact that if I'm too hungry, I can't fall asleep. Now for me, most nights I'm going to eat dinner sometime between 6:00 PM and 8:00 PM depending on time of year, schedules, what's going on, traffic, et cetera. And I tend to go to sleep somewhere between 10:00 PM and 11:00 PM plus or minus an hour, again, depending on time of year and what else is going on in life. So I normally have that buffer of two hours or so before going to sleep. However, there are some nights where even if I eat dinner around 7:00 PM, I'm quite hungry at 9:00 PM and I want to go to sleep. In that case, eating a small amount of food, ought not to disrupt your slow-wave sleep too much, but you do want to avoid eating large meals right before going to sleep unless, unless completely fasting and not eating something late at night will prevent you from getting into any sleep at all. In other words, it's better to make sure that you're getting to sleep than it is to avoid food just so that you get increased growth hormone output and into slow-wave sleep. I hope that's clear. You know, I have had times in my life where I'm working very, very hard and I missed dinner or something comes up and I know some people can fall asleep quite easily on an empty stomach. I've been able to do that, in particular if I'm very exhausted. I also rely on a handful of supplements to fall asleep each night, although I've not dependent on them. There have been times when I haven't been able to access those supplements and I can still fall asleep. But the point is that you don't want to be so hungry that you can't fall asleep. And yet in an ideal circumstance, especially if you're trying to increase the amount of slow-wave sleep, you would avoid food in the two hours or so before going to sleep. If you can avoid food for the three or four hours prior to sleep and still fall and stay asleep easily, that's even better for sake of increasing slow-wave sleep and growth hormone output. Now, there are some additional tools",

                "desc": "Scientific studies on exercise improving slow-wave sleep and the specific conditions of the studies.",
                "transcript": "Now, there are some additional tools for improving slow-wave sleep, in particular, the transitions between slow-wave sleep and the other sleep stages because even though, as I mentioned earlier, the early part of your night is occupied primarily by slow-wave sleep, all night long you're transitioning from slow-wave sleep into an intermediate stage of sleep and then into rapid eye movement sleep and then back again. It's just that in the early part of the night, more of that time is going to be occupied by slow-wave sleep. The two ways to improve slow-wave sleep that are well documented in the literature, and here we can point to some really nice papers that I'll reference in case you want to read further, is the first one is entitled, Exercise Improves the Quality of Slow-Wave Sleep by Increasing Slow-Wave Stability. Slow-wave Stability has to do with, as researchers call it, the amount of power present in the different aspects of slow-wave sleep, So this gets a little bit technical, but this is an instance in which they brought subjects into the laboratory, they measured brainwaves by EEG, they had some other measurements as well included in subjective measures of sleep, and they looked at whether or not people were doing exercise or not prior to sleep. Now, when I say prior to sleep, I mean not within six hours prior to bedtime. In fact, exercising intensely in the six hours prior to bedtime, for many people, not all, but for many people can disrupt the total amount of slow-wave sleep that they get and can also disrupt rapid eye movement sleep. So the conditions of the study were pretty straightforward. It was a randomized crossover trial. Basically, they had people either sleeping and monitoring their sleep or they had people doing an hour of exercise at 60% of their so-called VO2 max, you can look this up, for 60 minutes. 60% of their VO2 max, that was the intensity. It's breathing pretty hard, but not extremely hard. If we were going to map that to the so-called zone, zone 2 cardio being the kind of cardio you can do steady state while holding a conversation. This would be somewhere in the probably zone 3 or zone 4, although that's not exactly what 60% of VO2 Max is going to map to every time. Think about relatively challenging cardiovascular output for 60 minutes, and they had them do that at least six hours prior to bedtime, and, this is an important and, They did have the subjects in this study in all conditions abstain from caffeine and alcohol, so that's very important. And what they observed was an enhancement of slow-wave sleep. So exercise of this sort turns out to be a very potent form of improving slow-wave sleep. Now, I do not know, because the study as far as I know has not been done, whether or not doing resistance training or some other type of exercise would've led to the same effect, although I have to imagine that if it's moderately intense to intense resistance training provided it's done far enough away from going to sleep prior to six hours before sleep, that one ought to see the same effects. Although that was not a condition in this study. But it's a very nice study. They looked at everything from changes in core body temperature to caloric expenditure. They didn't see huge changes in core body temperature changes, so that couldn't explain the effect. It really appears that the major effect of improving slow-wave sleep was due to something in changing the fine structure of the brain waves that occur during slow-wave sleep. In fact, and this is an important point,",

                "transcript": "In fact, and this is an important point, the subjects in this study did not report subjectively feeling that much better from their sleep. So you might say, well then why would I even want to bother? However, it's well known that getting sufficient slow-wave sleep is important not just for repair, excuse me, for repair of bodily tissues, but also for repair of brain tissues and repair and wash out of debris in the brain. And that debris is known to lead to things like dementia. So getting the best quality slow-wave sleep is extremely important for body and for brain. And getting an hour of exercise that's moderately intense and making sure that you're not doing that exercise within the six hours prior to bedtime, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol, certainly within the six hours prior to bedtime, but I would say in the 8 to 12 hours prior to bedtime would be even better or not drinking alcohol at all, or I know there are people out there that don't drink caffeine at all, I'm not one of those people, but restricting that caffeine intake to the very early part of the day, that has been shown to improve the quality and the overall architecture of sleep and slow-wave sleep in particular. That's really what this study points to. There's another tool that can improve the amount and quality of slow-wave sleep that you achieve at night. This is actually a tool that I've started using over the last six to eight months or so. As many of you know, I believe in getting behaviors right before embracing changes in supplementation or prescription drugs. Behavioral tools consist of dos and don'ts, and the dos and don'ts for sleep are well documented in the Master Sleep episode and the Perfect Your Sleep episode and the toolkit for sleep. They include getting morning sunlight in your eyes or bright light of other kinds, avoiding bright light from 10:00 PM to 4:00 AM, et cetera, et cetera. All that information is in the toolkit for sleep and those other full-length episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast. Now, there are supplements that can greatly improve the depth of your sleep and that can shorten the latency to fall asleep. And here I'm not referring to melatonin,",

                "transcript": "And here I'm not referring to melatonin, as many of you perhaps already know, I'm not a fan of melatonin for a variety of reasons, mainly the fact that most melatonin supplements out there don't actually contain the exact amount of melatonin that's listed on the bottle. They contain either much, much more or much, much less. And that melatonin is a potent hormone that has impacts on not just sleep, but on other hormone systems as well. The supplements that I've suggested and that I personally take in order to improve my sleep are magnesium threonate, spelled T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E. And interchangeably with that one could use magnesium bisglycinate. I do consider those interchangeable because both cross into cells and cross the blood brain barrier in much the same way that makes them better candidates for improving sleep than some of the other forms of magnesium. So magnesium threonate, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine, and something called apigenin, which is essentially what you find in camomile that is the reason why camomile can make you sleepy. A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin. The dosages for those et cetera are described in the toolkit for sleep and why some people might want to avoid theanine. I'll just tell you, for those of you that have very intense dreams or that might sleepwalk or have night terrors, you might want to avoid theanine because it can enhance the kind of emotional and elaborate nature of dreams. Other people like that. So I'll take magnesium threonate, theanine, and apigenin as a so-called sleep stack about 30 to 60 minutes prior to sleep. I do not take them during the day. There is, however, another supplement that used in combination with the sleep stack that I just described or alone can greatly enhance the quality of your sleep. And in particular, people who are following a low carbohydrate diet who have trouble falling and staying asleep seem to benefit from it, and that is so-called inositol. Now, inositol comes in different forms, but the form that I'm referring to here in terms of enhancing slow-wave sleep is myo-inositol. There are an enormous number of studies on inositol for sake of mental health and for sake of enhancing various aspects of cellular function and for sake of improving sleep. I'd like to just highlight one paper, title of this paper will make it clear what it's about. The title of the paper is The Impact of Myo-Inositol Supplementation on Sleep Quality in Pregnant Women: A Randomized Double-Blind Placebo Controlled Study. Now, as I just told you, the study was carried out on pregnant women, but there have been other studies of inositol on other populations. And the major takeaway from these studies is that inositol can improve the quality of sleep and can adjust the architecture of sleep in ways that make it a great candidate for improving the structure and maybe also the duration of slow-wave sleep in particular. I find that if I'm following a lower carbohydrate diet,",

Or if I eat four to six hours prior to bedtime, then I tend to be pretty hungry around bedtime. And sometimes if I'm exercising very hard or if I'm working a lot, even if I eat dinner around seven and I go to sleep around 10:00 PM, I might be a little bit hungry still at 10:00 PM. In that case, I find that taking 900 milligrams of myo-inositol in addition to the other sleep stack that I just described greatly enhances my ability to fall asleep and to get terrific quality sleep. I do monitor my sleep. I do that two ways. I do that these days with my Eight Sleep sleep tracker, and I use a WHOOP sleep tracker when I sleep. The combination of those two taps into different aspects of sleep tracking, heart rate variability, movement, et cetera. In a future episode, we'll talk about what are the best devices for monitoring sleep, which have certain advantages and others have disadvantages. But I certainly see it in the objective data that is from the sleep tracking data. And I also observe subjectively that taking 900 milligrams of inositol prior to sleep, again 30 to 60 minutes prior to sleep, can greatly enhance the ability to fall asleep and for me to stay asleep throughout the night. I also noticed another effect, which is that if I wake up in the middle of the night to use the restroom, which I often do, I find it much easier to fall back asleep. I don't tend to get into kind of looping thought and things of that sort in the middle of the night. And that may relate to the fact that myo-inositol has been studied in many cases for its role in controlling anxiety that is for reducing anxiety. And that's one of the reasons, in fact, one of many reasons why people take myo-inositol during the daytime. There are studies of myo-inositol for dealing with anxiety, for sleep as we're discussing now, and even for improving fertility and things of that sort, in particular in women. So again, 900 milligrams of an inositol can be a useful tool. 60 minutes of exercise, as described previously, can be a tool, and certainly avoiding caffeine and alcohol is an excellent tool for enhancing the total amount of slow-wave sleep. Jack had a second part to his question, he asked is having a high level of rapid eye movement sleep and a lower level of deep sleep likely to cause any health issues? And to be honest, it's not really clear that it would cause any specific health issues, although if we think about what the specific roles of slow-wave sleep versus rapid eye movement sleep are, again, rapid eye movement sleep being laden with highly emotional dreams, It's thought to act as a sort of trauma release where people are paralyzed in body and that's a healthy paralysis, they're so-called sleep atonia, but undergoing some pretty emotional stuff within their dreams, and there is a lack of ability for the body to secrete adrenaline during rapid eye movement sleep, that's thought to be important for emotional repair, if you will, during the night. Certainly studies where people have been deprived of rapid eye movement sleep have shown that their ability to manage emotionally during the daytime is reduced. Certainly if you have reduced rapid eye movement sleep for multiple nights, that's going to be the case. The only caveat to that is that there are certain forms of treating depression that involve specifically depriving people of rapid eye movement sleep. That's a whole other story that was covered in the podcast episode with Dr. Nolan Williams. So if you want to learn more as to why that's the case, check out that episode. But because slow-waves sleep, which occurs again during the early part of the night, is when growth hormones is released and when there's this periodic washout of debris within the brain, and to some extent within certain tissues of the body, you could imagine that reduced low-wave sleep would lead to reduced ability to recover from exercise, from injury, maybe even relate to the immune system. However, I am personally not aware of any studies that specifically looked at the ratio of slow-wave sleep to rapid eye movement sleep, and that focused in particular on reduced slow-wave sleep for bodily repair. Those studies might be out there, I was not able to find them. If you are able to find them, please put them in the comment section and I would love to check out those studies. So I don't think that one needs to be overly concerned if you're not getting a balance of slow-wave sleep to rapid eye movement sleep, that's perfect. However, and as I mentioned earlier, it would be good to strive to try and balance the amount of slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep across the entire night. If you think about it, that will also tell you whether or not you're getting sufficient total sleep. And I don't want to open up another set of questions here as I'm about to close out an answer to this question, but I do often get asked the question whether or not four hours is enough, or six hours is enough, or eight hours is enough. Well, it's impossible to know exactly how much sleep each individual person needs. And of course, each individual person will need a different amount of total sleep depending on the amount of stress and physical strain and various other things they're dealing with in their daily waking life. However, it's generally the case that kids and people that are undergoing puberty and certainly in early infancy need more sleep than adults do. So as you age, you do in fact need less sleep. One good metric of whether or not you are getting enough sleep is whether or not you're sleepy during the daytime or not. If you're falling asleep a lot during the daytime, you're probably not getting enough sleep at night. That's sort of a duh, but it's an important duh to pay attention to. And for those of us, like myself, that need a 20 or 30 minute nap in the afternoon, great. That doesn't necessarily mean you're not getting enough sleep at night. So if you get sleepy enough to want a nap in the afternoon, that's not an indication necessarily that you are not getting enough sleep at night. However, if you're only sleeping four or five hours per night, it's very hard to imagine that you're getting a balance of slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep. Once you get into the range of sleeping six to eight hours and certainly 8 to 10 hours per night, the probability that you're getting a balance of slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep greatly increases. So if I were to throw out a number, I would say for most people, that is for 95% of people out there, getting at least six hours of sleep per night, at least, and ideally more like seven or eight is going to be the goal. However, I've noticed, for instance, for myself, unless I'm exercising extremely intensely or I'm going through a lot of emotional or physical stress in my daily life, getting six and a half to seven hours of sleep per night allows me to feel really good and refreshed throughout the day. And that's especially the case if I get that 20 or 30 minute nap in the afternoon or use NSDR, Non-Sleep Deep Rest. So I hope that answers your question, Jack, and there are, of course, I'm extending the answer to all others who upvoted that question or who might be interested in improving their slow-wave sleep. There are some dos, there are some don'ts that I just described. I suggest trying various things one by one to see what works best for you so you don't necessarily need to leap to doing the 60 minutes of exercise plus the inositol, et cetera. However, I do encourage everyone to avoid alcohol and caffeine within the 8 to 12 hours prior to sleep. And again, if you're not using either of those, that would be even better, at least in terms of sleep architecture. Thank you for joining for the beginning",

To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these Ask Me Anything Sessions plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the Huberman Lab podcast standard channel and Premium Tools not released anywhere else, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. Just to remind you why we launched the Huberman Lab podcast premium Channel, it's really twofold. First of all, it's to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which of course will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length. We are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast. And to fund research, in particular, research done on human beings, so not animal models, but on human beings, which I think we all agree is a species that we are most interested in. And we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance. And those protocols will be distributed through all channels, not just the premium channel, but through all channels, Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. So the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now, an especially exciting feature of the Premium channel is that the Tiny Foundation has generously offered to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel. So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science-related tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to sign up for the Huberman Lab premium channel, again, there's a cost of $10 per month, or you can pay $100 upfront for the entire year. That will give you access to all the AMAs, you can ask questions and get answers to your questions, and you'll of course get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well. There will also be some premium content such as transcripts of the AMAs and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman Lab podcast episodes not found elsewhere. And again, you'll be supporting research for mental health, physical health, and performance. You can sign up for the premium channel by going to hubermanlab.com/premium.

But the most common definition of an adaptogen is a compound that is typically a supplement or a drug. Although, it could be a behavior, if you really think about it, that helps you adapt to and buffer stress. So when you hear about adaptogens, there are three main categories of adaptogens that come to mind. The first are things that are contained in food. So these would be vitamins or micronutrients that one could easily find in food. But one would have to consume a fairly restricted number or type of foods in order to obtain those things, or consume a lot of those foods in order to get sufficient dosages of those adaptogen compounds in order to buffer stress. Some good examples of these would",

And then that's what gives rise to this idea that antioxidants are good for us. Now, over the last 10 years or so, there's been a shift. What shift has occurred? Well, about 10 years ago, you often heard about antioxidants, antioxidants, antioxidants and vitamins, antioxidants in this food, this superfood, et cetera. And why were people talking about antioxidants? Well, just to remind you, reactive oxygen species are types of reactions and molecules that occur in cells when cells get stressed and/or age. And antioxidants are the compounds that reduce those reactive oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species are bad for cells because they tend to hinder the function of mitochondria, which are associated with energy production in those cells. So what do we know for sure? We know that as cells get older, or as any cell or biological system organ tissue, et cetera, get stressed a lot over time, the number of reactive oxygen species increases in those cells and tissues and organs. And antioxidants, which can include certain vitamins but also some micronutrients, are effective in reducing those reactive oxygen species. Now, what's occurred over the last 10 years",

                "transcript": "Now, what's occurred over the last 10 years is that we know that reactive oxygen species are a major source of depleting cellular function by way of depleting mitochondrial function. But they are just one of many mechanisms that can deplete cellular function mitochondrial function. So nowadays, you'll hear about reactive oxygen species and antioxidants, but not as much as you used to. Now, you hear a lot more about inflammatory responses and inflammatory cytokines also being an issue. And the truth is all of these things are an issue. So going back to this question about adaptogens, adaptogens include these three categories. I've told you the first, which are the vitamins and micronutrients that are contained in food that can reduce reactive oxygen species and other aspects of cell or stress, such as inflammatory cytokines. What are some of those things that occur in foods? Well, in order to answer that, let's just think about what sorts of foods, themselves, can act as adaptogens. It's commonly held that the dark, leafy greens type foods, for those of you that eat plants. And I think the majority of people out there do eat plants. I know that the carnivore diet and lion diet and some other diets tend to exclude plants, and we'll address that briefly at some point in today's discussion. But dark, leafy greens are known to contain a number of compounds in the form of vitamins and micronutrients that are very effective in reducing reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines. So if you're somebody who's interested in adaptogens and adaptogenic processes, reducing stress and buffering stress, which, of course, has its role in buffering daily stress in order to help you sleep better to improve cellular function for longevity sports performance, cognitive performance, that is all good and it makes sense why people would be interested in adaptogens. But remember that the two main adaptogens",

                "transcript": "But remember that the two main adaptogens that you should think to first are going to be behaviors and nutrition. I started with nutrition on purpose. As I mentioned, we'll get to behaviors in a moment. So if you're interested in adaptogens at all, I highly recommend that you include at least two to four servings of dark, leafy greens and/or cruciferous vegetables per day. I think that would be highly advantageous. And just be aware that excessively heating dark, leafy greens or cruciferous vegetables can actually destroy the very nutrients and micronutrients that act in an adaptogenic way. That does not mean that you need to eat raw broccoli or cauliflower, just the thought of that makes me nauseous, it's very hard to digest. Some people might like that or can digest it more easily than others. So it's perfectly fine to cook your cruciferous vegetables and dark leafy greens, but you don't want to overcook them. What's overcooking and what's undercooking? There's no strict cutoff in terms of temperature. But basically, what the literature says is that if you heat vegetables to the point where the colored fluid is leaching out of them into a broth type, into water or whatever fluid surrounds them, well, then you would be well off to ingest that fluid as well because it contained in the water or the fluid that's leaching out from the cruciferous vegetables or from the dark leafy greens, are going to be a lot of those very adaptogenic molecules that you're interested in the first place. OK. So I probably surprised some people",

                "transcript": "So I probably surprised some people by starting off my answer to the question of \"What are adaptogens? Are they worth thinking about in pursuing? And if so, how can I get them?\" by talking about food. But I think it is important to understand that you can get a lot of adaptogens from food. And indeed, some of the best adaptogens do come from dark leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables. So I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that. The other two categories of adaptogens are going to be supplement-based adaptogens and then behavioral adaptogens. Again, here adaptogen defined as anything that can buffer stress in a substantial or meaningful way in order to support cellular health, organ health, and overall daily living and functioning, including sleep and performance in mental health. So the second category of adaptogens are going to be supplements. And here, again, I just want to take a step back, make sure that we are clear about our operational definition about what a supplement is. We had an episode all about how to design a rational guide to supplementation, which included, for example, the idea that for some people, the optimal dosage of many supplements is going to be zero. And for other people, the dosage will be something else. But to really pinpoint the key message from that episode that I'd like to reiterate now, but a key message from that episode that I'd like to reiterate now is that many people think of supplements as just vitamin supplements. And for that reason, you'll often hear the argument, \"Oh, well, aren't supplements just expensive urine. Couldn't you get all of that from food?\" Aren't you just urinating out all the water-soluble vitamins and maybe even storing excess amounts of the fat-soluble vitamins in a way that's unhealthy or not cost-effective?\" And so on. When we talk about supplements, yes, it can include vitamin supplements. However, there are many compounds that we would describe as supplements that are not vitamin supplements, and that you could not obtain from food or that you could never obtain from food in sufficient enough qualities to have a robust positive biological effect without consuming an enormous number of calories or overriding your gut mechanically. For instance, if there were, say, a herb, and we'll talk about such herbs in a moment, that contained an effective adaptogen, but you would never want to eat the plant itself or include that herb in any kind of recipe, well then, chances are this herb, which we'll define in a moment, is not a vitamin supplement. It is probably not even best thought of as a supplement, it's best thought of as a compound that sold over the counter, much like a prescription drug.",

                "transcript": "that sold over the counter, much like a prescription drug. Although, it's not prescription. It doesn't require a prescription to get it. So there are a lot of things like that we include under the umbrella of this word supplements. And unfortunately, because of that, a lot of people think, \"Oh, you don't need supplements.\" And, of course, you don't need supplements per se, but many people do derive tremendous benefit from them. In the context of adaptogens, there are two or three in particular that can be very beneficial for buffering the stress response, especially, over short periods of time of about two to three weeks. So when would you use these? Well, for instance, if you are in a particularly stressful mode of life, either because of family or relational or school or work demands or new kid in the house or-- any number of different things, or you've been ill or you're recovering from injury, taking an adaptogen in the form of a supplement can actually be very useful for buffering this hormone and the general system is associated with, called cortisol. It's very healthy to have high levels of cortisol early in the day, shortly after you wake up. And then that ought to taper off toward the afternoon and evening. However, if cortisol is chronically elevated throughout the day, or if that peak in cortisol is arriving too late in the day, that is known to be associated with mental health and physical health issues. Has been shown by labs at Stanford and elsewhere. It's been shown in animal models and in humans. Talked many times before, and I'll just remind you again. One of the best ways to restrict that cortisol peak to the early part of the day is to get morning sunlight in your eyes as soon as you can. Once the sun is up, get outside face in the direction of the sun, even on overcast days. Don't wear sunglasses, look at it for five to 30 minutes. Definitely blink so you don't damage your eyes, so on and so forth. Why five minutes or 30 minutes? Well, five minutes on a clear day should be sufficient, longer would be fine. Again, blink so that you protect your eyes. Blink as needed. Face in the general direction of the sun. On days when you have a lot of overcast or it's really dark, dense cloud cover, well, then, you'd want to be outside longer. And if you don't have access to sunlight for whatever reason, then you want to do the same thing with bright artificial lights indoors, either so-called SAD lamp or otherwise. That's a great way to restrict that cortisol peak to early in the day. But even if you're doing that, if you have a stressful life for whatever reason, even if you're getting that morning sunlight, which I hope you are, you're getting your exercise, you're trying to sleep better and more as we all should most of the time, well, then you may be somebody who wants to take a adaptogen in the form of a supplement. And the three supplements that can be very effective in buffering cortisol are ashwagandha, which I'll talk about first, lion's mane and chaga. Lion's mane and chaga are in the fungi group, so they count as mushrooms.",

                "transcript": "so they count as mushrooms. They are not psychedelic mushrooms. Let's talk about ashwagandha first. Ashwagandha is at the top of the list because it is indeed a very potent adaptogen. How can I say that? Well, there are a number of studies now, including several excellent ones in humans, that report that taking two doses of 300 milligrams of ashwagandha per day can, very dramatically, buffer cortisol. So this is something that you would have a near-impossible time accessing from food. I can't imagine that, unless you're cooking with the very sources of ashwagandha and extracting exact amounts that you'd be able to get this in any other form except supplement form. So here I'm going to just briefly reference a paper and we can provide a reference link to this, that is. This is a paper from 2012 that's had a lot of excellent follow-up papers that support it. The title of the paper is A prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of safety and efficacy of high concentration of full spectrum extract of ashwagandha root in reducing stress and anxiety in adults. And it's a really nice study. Not a huge subject pool, but both men and women, and has carried out for long enough that they got to see some really interesting results. And I think the most interesting result is that taking 300 milligrams of ashwagandha twice a day led to enormous-- I mean, just enormous changes in serum cortisol. The statistical significance that they observed in the study was really fantastic, fantastically high statistical significance. They saw the effects of ashwagandha on day 15, having initiated the ashwagandha consumption on day one, of course, day 30 and day 45. And again, this was dramatic reductions in stress as perceived by people. So subjective stress and cortisol levels. So ashwagandha is very potent at reducing cortisol. How would you recapitulate this if you wanted to use ashwagandha to buffer stress? Well, a couple of key points. I mentioned earlier that you want your cortisol peak to come earlier in the day. Therefore, you would not want to buffer cortisol early in the day. In fact, cortisol peaking early in the day provides an anti-inflammatory immune-supporting, focus and mood supporting effect all day long. So I would recommend that people take their first dose of ashwagandha anywhere from 250 to 300 milligrams. Sometime in the early afternoon and again in the evening, as opposed to taking a morning dose in an afternoon dose. Also, if you're somebody who's exercising for sake of trying to induce adaptations like hypertrophy, the growth of muscles or strength, or improve your endurance in any way, muscular endurance or more traditional cardiovascular endurance, then I recommend that you not take your ashwagandha prior to exercise because part of the adaptation response is triggered by increases in cortisol during exercise. Sort of in the same way that some of the best adaptations to exercise are reductions in blood pressure and resting heart rate. And those are stimulated by increases in blood pressure and increases in heart rate during exercise. That's just how these biological systems work. So the takeaway is pretty simple. If you're interested in using ashwagandha as an adaptogen, I would restrict it to later in the day if you can and not before exercise. Divide it into two doses of 250 to 300 milligrams. That's what this paper and other papers like it seem to indicate. And then a very important final point about ashwagandha, which is that if you're going to take ashwagandha, I recommend not taking it for longer than a month-and-a-half as they did in this study. In fact, I would suggest that you only take ashwagandha around periods of moderate to extreme stress. What's moderate, what's extreme is going to depend on what you're going through. Only how much stress and life events you can tolerate. So if you've had trouble sleeping and that's unusual for you. Or, you're dealing with a very difficult life circumstances or excessive work demand, or a new kid, as I mentioned before. Well, then buffering stress with ashwagandha, buffering cortisol in the afternoon and evening can be very beneficial for you. But then I would say after about 30 days maximum, I would take at least two to four weeks off. Two weeks is probably enough, but four weeks off because you don't want to chronically buffer cortisol. It's just not a good idea. But that said, I think ashwagandha is a very powerful adaptogen. I would place at the top of the list of supplement-based adaptogens. But keep in mind that even if you're taking a supplement-based adaptogen, that's no reason to abandon the nutrition and behavioral type adaptogenic effects that you can create through eating dark leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables, then we'll talk about the behaviors in a moment. The other two supplement-based adaptogens, as I mentioned,",

                "transcript": "The other two supplement-based adaptogens, as I mentioned, are lion's mane mushroom and chaga. And I get asked a lot about lion's mane and chaga for sake of their purported roles in acting as nootropics as quote unquote \"smart drugs.\" There are fewer data on the beneficial roles of lion's mane and chaga for sake of nootropic effects-- we'll do an entire episode on nootropics at some point. But there have been a few studies showing that lion's made in supplementation and chaga supplementation can improve memory, and maybe even divergent thinking associated with creativity and things of that sort. Again, these are not psychedelic mushrooms. That said, there are good data showing that 1,000 milligrams, that is 1 gram, of lion's mane per day and/or-- I will talk about the end/or portion in a moment, and/or chaga mushroom at 500 to 1,500 milligrams per day can act as adaptogens in, again, reducing cortisol. But also and mainly reducing some of the anti-inflammatory cytokines that are known to circulate in high abundance when you're under a lot of psychological and/or physical stress. Things like interleukin 6 and some related molecules. So here's what I would recommend. If you are interested in exploring adaptogens, I'm a big fan, as some of you probably know, if you heard that episode on rational guide to supplementation. I'm a big fan of mainly focusing on taking supplements in single-ingredient formulations so that you can figure out what dosages are best for you, and so that you can toggle in and out those adaptogens as needed. So I, of course, am a fan of taking certain blends and mixes, the one that we talk about a lot on this podcast and we have been a sponsor from the beginning, I've taken for a decade now long before I ever had a podcast, is Athletic Greens, which some of you might note does contain some ashwagandha. Although, the levels of ashwagandha that are contained in Athletic Greens are low enough that I don't see any issue with taking Athletic Greens consistently, day to day, every day, because you're not getting anywhere near that 600-milligram dosage. But the idea is that if you were going to take any adaptogen for sake of buffering stress over the short term, say for a week or two weeks or a month, and then taking that recommended time off, I would start with ashwagandha. And then if you feel you need something else to buffer stress, keeping in mind, of course, that you're doing the behavioral and the nutritional things to buffer stress as well. You can never abandon those, right? Well, then I would suggest adding 1,000 milligrams or 1,000 milligrams of chaga per day and seeing how that further benefits your system in terms of buffering stress. How would you measure if your stress is being reduced? Well, you're going to be sleeping better at night. You're going to feel subjectively better, lower levels of anxiety. All the things that are measured in the types of studies I described before. Now, of course, there's nothing preventing you from taking 600 milligrams of ashwagandha, a gram of lion's mane, and a gram of chaga. I know some people like to just kind of go full tilt into everything. But I am a big believer in really trying to isolate which supplements and molecules work best for you and which ones don't. Do you need to cycle on and off lion's mane and chaga?",

                "transcript": "Do you need to cycle on and off lion's mane and chaga? I'm not aware of any data showing that you do. If, however, you're taking them every day, I recommend that you cycle off them after a period of 30 days or so. And I want to be very clear about this, just because I said cycle off after a period of 30 days or so does not mean that you can't take them for a shorter period of time. So for instance, if you know that you're coming up on a big week of stress, well, then you could take ashwagandha and/or lion's mane and/or chaga for that week or just that week or heading into that week or in the following week and then stop. There's no reason why you couldn't take them even just for one day. Although, the effects tend to be a bit cumulative, at least, when we're talking about buffering anxiety. In terms of buffering cortisol, that's a very potent effect that as far as we know, is going to take place on day one. Again, keep that cortisol buffering effect away from exercise. At least, don't take it before exercise. And try and buffer your cortisol in the afternoon and evening, and this is assuming that you're working a conventional shift and you're not up all night and sleeping all day for sake of shift work. So hopefully, that clarifies things about what adaptogens are. In fact, I never actually read the specific question, but I think I've touched on a number of issues that were related to the specific question. And then I'll answer the last portion of the answer to this question in a moment, as it relates to behavioral tools that can act as adaptogens. The question, itself, was there's a lot of mixed information out there about adaptogens like ashwagandha. And I think that relates to what I said earlier, which is that the definition of an adaptogen has not really been cemented in various communities. It's different in different communities, and it's generally used as a matter of convenience rather than really strictly defining what it is. And hopefully, we've defined it accurately and broadly enough today as something that buffers stress. The second part of the question was what does the scientific evidence say about adaptogens and their ability to mediate body stress response? They say quite a lot, and they say that the stress response can be buffered substantially by certain adaptogens. Mainly, dark leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables, ashwagandha, lion's mane, and chaga, and of course, all the behavioral things that are critical that I will list off in a moment. And then the third portion of the question is, is there any solid evidence that has an effect on neurotransmitters or the HPA, which is part of the stress modulation access? The best evidence is that adaptogens can reduce cortisol itself. There is very little evidence that adaptogens can directly modulate neurotransmitters or neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, et cetera. But by adjusting the timing and levels of cortisol, especially in the afternoon and evening, that is going to have indirect effects on levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, et cetera, and serotonin. But not direct effects. So the general contour that makes for an ideal diurnal schedule-- you heard of nocturnal, well, the opposite that is diurnal, being awake during the daytime and asleep at night. The ideal kind of landscape of neurotransmitters is higher levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine in the early part of the day and cortisol, so-called catecholamines, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. And high levels of cortisol early in the day as directed by sunlight, exercise, caffeine, hydration, movement, all that stuff, being awake and busy and outside or indoors with bright lights and moving about in the early part of the day and into the early afternoon, that's the best possible way that we are aware of to try and get those catecholamines released at the highest levels in the early part of the day. And then the ideal contour of a 24-hour cycle will be in the later half of the day. The evening and nighttime, you have higher levels of things like serotonin the GABAergic system, all the things that are somewhat sedative in preparing you for sleep and lower levels of the catecholamines and cortisol as I described before. So to directly answer the question, \"Is there any evidence that adaptogens can alter your neurotransmitters?\" Yes, but only indirectly. And yet, that indirect control over neurotransmitters is substantial and is important. And if you do what I described, such as getting morning sunlight and ideally, you'd get a little bit of deliberate cold water exposure, by the way, to boost adrenaline and norepinephrine and dopamine, those catecholamines early in the day. So quick one-minute cold shower, even or a three-minute cold shower, or if you have access to an ice bath early in the day, plus some sunlight, doesn't matter which one you do first, doing that early in the day is really going to create that peak of cortisol, dopamine, epinephrine early in the day. I can't emphasize how beneficial all of that can be. And exercise, if you can, early end of the day. Some people can't exercise till later in the day. I'd rather see people exercise later in the day than not at all, provided it does not disrupt their nighttime sleep, which of course, sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance. So yes, there is modulation of neurotransmitters,",

                "transcript": "So yes, there is modulation of neurotransmitters, but most of those are downstream of the effects on cortisol that we've been talking about. So we've defined nutritional adaptogens, supplement-based adaptogens-- although, I don't really like the word supplements anymore unless we're talking about vitamin supplements for reasons we talked about earlier. And then there's the third category of adaptogens, which are the behavioral tools that you can use to buffer stress, which qualifies those as an adaptogen. I think it's really important that we always keep in mind that yes, there are supplements, yes, there are prescription drugs out there. In fact, there are prescription drugs that you can get from a doctor that will potently zero out your cortisol. But most doctors are very reluctant to prescribe those drugs because cortisol provides a very important and functional role early in the day. Behaviors are very effective at reducing cortisol. What are the most effective behaviors to reduce cortisol? Well, we talked about, one, to restrict cortisol the early part of the day, which is viewing morning sunlight. But how would you buffer cortisol in the late afternoon? It's going to be all the things associated with reducing stress. For instance, 10 minutes or even-- my laboratory and other laboratories have shown is even five minutes a day of just what would be called mindfulness meditation, very simple. You don't need to overcomplicate this. You could use a great app like the Waking Up app or another app of the sort. Or, you can simply sit down, eyes closed, breathe through your nose, and just concentrate on your breathing. Every time your mind drifts to something else, bring it back to your breathing. That's shown to reduce stress. You could do a five-minute deliberate breath work practice. My laboratory has published some work related to that. The breath work practice could be any number of things. The two that I recommend the most would be double inhale, followed by a full exhale, and then repeat for a period of five minutes. Known to substantially reduce anxiety, stress, and the various physiological systems associated with arousal. You could also use box breathing, inhale, hold, exhale, hold for equal durations for a period of five minutes, will substantially reduce stress. I'm a big fan, as many of you know, of yoga nidra, which involves no movement. It involves just lying there, listening to a script. Lots of yoga or scripts available online. If you're not interested in the intentions and other things, including yoga nidra, you can buffer stress using an adaptogen like NSDR, non-sleep deep breast. If you're interested in trying these sorts of things. There's a NSDR protocol that's 10 minutes long. Just put my name, Huberman, and NSDR into the search browser on YouTube. And Virtusan is provided in NSDR that's completely zero cost and works very well for reducing stress. It will also help teach your system and teach you how to learn to fall asleep better at night. So any of those practices, five to 10-minute breathing practice or meditation, or a NSDR yoga nidra. If you can do longer 20 or 30 minutes in the afternoon, that's known to buffer cortisol substantially as well. Any time you're encountering stress in real time, I highly recommend a tool over and over because it's so effective. The fastest way we to buffer stress and calm down is the so-called physiological sigh, big Inhale through the nose till your lungs are empty, but then sneak in a little bit more air by second inhale, maximally inflate the lungs, then a long exhale until you're lungs are empty. One to three of those will reduce your stress substantially. Over time that should reduce, that is, buffer your cortisol acting as an adaptogen. There are a lot of things. You can take a hot bath, you could take a hot shower, you can listen to some pleasant music. Anything that reduces your stress, technically, is an adaptogen. So I hope I've thoroughly answered your question by yours-- I mean, of course, this answer is going out to all of you. This is a question that was asked by Justine Bevilacqua. I hope I pronounced that correctly, Justine. And thank you for that question. I think there are a lot of people interested in adaptogens. So now, you can use nutrition such as cruciferous vegetables, dark leafy greens. And I should also mention, if you're not ingesting enough calories each day, well, then you are going to be in a mild mode of stress. That's not to say that some people shouldn't take in fewer calories than they burn in order to lose weight, some people really need to do that for their health or for whatever other reason. But if you restrict calories too much, you are going to increase cortisol output. So keep that in mind. So ingest sufficient calories for you and for your goals. Aim to get dark leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables, don't overcook them. If you want to explore supplements, the best supplements to act as adaptogens are going to be ashwagandha, lion's mane, and chaga. One or two or three of those-- although, if you're going to pick one, I'd recommend ashwagandha, 600 milligrams per day, taken in the later-half of the day. And then there are the behavioral tools that we just talked about now, which are anything that reduces stress can reduce cortisol. And in doing so, are technically adaptogens. If you want to know more behavioral tools",

Learning how to work with it, how to dance with it, how to buffer it is terrific. But zeroing out cortisol is not the goal. The goal is to learn to modulate and control your cortisol, and that's really what adaptogens are all about. Thank you for joining for the beginning of this ask-me-anything episode. To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these ask-me-anything sessions, plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the Huberman Lab podcast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. Just to remind you why we launched the Huberman Lab podcast premium channel, it's really twofold. First of all, it's to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which, of course, will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length. We are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast, and to fund research in particular research done on human beings. So not animal models, but on human beings, which I think we all agree is the species that we are most interested in. And we are going to, specifically, fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance. And those protocols will be distributed through all channels. Not just the premium channel, but through all channels, Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. So the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the Tiny Foundation has generously offered to do a dollar-for-dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel. So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science-related tools, for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to sign up for the Human Lab premium channel, again, there's a cost of $10 per month, or you can pay $100 up front for the entire year. That will give you access to all the AMA's. You can ask questions and get answers to your questions. And you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well. There will also be some premium content such as transcripts of the AMA's and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman Lab podcast episodes, and not found elsewhere. And again, you'll be supporting research for mental health, physical health, and performance. You can sign up for the premium channel by going to hubermanlab.com/premium. Again, that's hubermanlab.com/premium. And as always, thank you for your interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]",

And as always, I will strive to be as accurate as possible, as thorough as possible, and yet, as concise as possible. Our first question is about motivation, in particular, how to maintain motivation over long periods of time. This was the question asked by Martin Zokov. He wrote, \"I alternate between periods of two different states that vary from a few weeks to a couple of months. I have extremely high motivation in one state, where I can do multiple things-- side projects, making music, as well as my main things, or really low-motivational states, where I can barely do anything, and I only look for short term entertainment.\" I'm guessing, short-term entertainment comes in the form of video games, social media, and just doing generally unproductive things, as we all do from time to time. He goes on to write, \"What would be the best set of protocols to normalize those extremes into a more stable and consistent state?\" Well, first off, this is an excellent question. I say that because it's a question that I hear a lot, and I think that many people are interested in knowing how motivated they ought to feel. And I think a lot of people also feel a lot less motivated than they would like. Now, here the question was, specifically, about how to not go from these extremes of days or weeks of high motivation to days or weeks of low motivation. But before we do that, we need to take a step back and acknowledge that, just as with anxiety, or happiness,",

In fact, most of the time, we don't even realize how we experience motivation. We just know whether or not we feel a high barrier or a low barrier to leaning into work and getting things done. In fact, I have a good friend who did many years in the special operations community, and then went on to the finance community, and then now works in health and wellness community. He has a great mental image for all of us to adopt. It's certainly one that I've adopted, which is-- for anything in our life, we can either be back on our heels, flat footed, or forward center of mass. Back in our heels, meaning really struggling; flat footed, meaning we're doing OK; or forward center of mass, meaning that we feel as if we're really tackling things and that we are in control of our environment or at least to some degree. So I place that imagery in your mind because I'll return to it a little bit later in the question when we get into some of the underlying circuitry and tools. In the meantime, I want to remind everybody what",

                "transcript": "In the meantime, I want to remind everybody what the basis of motivation is. There are many neurochemicals and neural circuits involved in what we call motivation, but a central theme of the neuroscience of motivation is that the neural modulator dopamine is involved. Now, dopamine does other things besides control motivation. In fact, it controls light adaptation in the retina, that is your eye. It controls a number of different things in terms of movement. It controls all sorts of things, but it is strongly related to the motivation pathways. How do we know that? Well, there are experiments on animals and humans, which show that even in the absence of dopamine, or in the presence of very low dopamine, I should say, people and animals can still experience pleasure. However, when dopamine levels are too low, people's ability to pursue pleasure, or their willingness to pursue pleasure, in particular, their willingness to undergo effort to pursue pleasure or any goal of any kind, not just pleasure, any goal of any kind, is strongly regulated by the levels of dopamine. So if dopamine levels are too low, people simply will not put in the effort to obtain or reach a goal. If dopamine levels are adequately high, they will put in that effort. And if dopamine levels go too high, you actually see something that is pathologic, which is that people consider every goal a reasonable goal. This is often seen in the manic phase of a manic bipolar person. So for instance, somebody with manic bipolar who is in a manic episode, dopamine levels are very, very high, and they will think every idea is a great idea. And they will have tons of energy to do that, so much so so that they're not sleeping. So obviously, that's not what we want. What we want, and what the question asker, Martin, is asking about, is how to keep dopamine levels in a range that allow us to lean into effort but that we don't expend our ability to stay motivated. And we can really trace that back to a biochemical/neural circuit statement, which is-- we really want to control our output of dopamine and the baseline levels of dopamine from which that output is taken. In other words, we want to think about dopamine as a reservoir or residing in a reservoir.",

And one of the best analogies that I've ever heard was by a previous guest on the Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Kyle Gillett, who's a medical doctor, obesity specialist, expert in hormones. We did an episode on optimizing hormones in males with Dr. Kyle Gillett. You can find that at hubermanlab.com or anywhere you can find podcasts. Dr. Gillett offered an analogy of the baseline levels of dopamine as a wave pool, and I really like this. So if you think about this pool full of dopamine-- and here we're just talking about the dopamine that resides in the circuits of the brain that control motivation. But that pool of dopamine you could imagine is just sitting there not doing much of anything while you're asleep. In fact, while you're sleeping, you're replenishing those dopamine levels. I'll tell you another tool in a moment to replenish those dopamine levels. But if you were to pursue a goal, really, really go forward-center of mass for many, many hours or many, many days, in some cases, and pursue a goal or multiple goals and you're really driven to do a ton, what you're effectively doing is generating waves in that wave pool. And if those waves are too big, well, then the waves can't keep repeating themselves. So think about the wave as the motivation and the depth of the pool is the reservoir of dopamine. And if those waves are too big, too much excitement, too much motivation, too much center of mass for a given period of time, then the water in this wave pool sloshes out of the wave pool lowering the reservoir. And then there are really three ways that you can replenish that reservoir, and you want to maintain or replenish that reservoir if it's been depleted. How do you do that?

                "transcript": "Well, first of all, quality sleep. So when I say quality, I mean where you're getting enough slow wave sleep and rapid I move in sleep. So for some people, six hours, for some people, eight hours. Some people might even need a little bit more or a little bit less. We have episodes-- the Perfect Your Sleep episode, the Master Your Sleep episode. We have a toolkit for sleep. All available at zero cost at hubermanlab.com, links et cetera. So check those out for getting your sleep right. But sleep is really when you replenish that reservoir of dopamine. So you cannot ignore sleep. I'll come back to this in a moment. The second science supported tool that's really been shown to replenish dopamine, in particular, dopamine within the pathways that regulate motivation, is a practice I've talked about before on the podcast called non-sleep deep rest, sometimes called yoga nidra, although, yoga nidra is a little bit different. There are two studies out of Denmark that have explored yoga nidra in the context of dopamine. The first one simply involved having people do a yoga nidra practice. Again, this doesn't involve any movement, but it involves people, potentially you, doing anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes, although there are now data showing that as short as 10 minutes of a non-sleep deep rest, a.k.a. yoga nidra protocol, leads to dramatic, really dramatic increases in striatal dopamine reserves. So it essentially is replenishing the dopamine reserve pool. This is why I'm such a fan of using NSDR, a.k.a. yoga nidra, at least once a day and especially under times when you're engaging in a lot of high output. And when I say, especially at times when you're engaging in a lot of high output, this is a mistake many people make. They push, push, push, push, push. They're in pursuit of a goal. Then they hit that point where they're exhausted. Then they start doing all the dopamine reserve pool replenishing tools such as yoga nidra or NSDR. The real key is to always tap off that or refill that reservoir once a day before it's completely depleted. Now, this gets into some of the biochemistry of dopamine and the relevant circuits, but it takes a lot longer to restore the dopamine reservoir-- think of it still as a wave pool, but that reservoir from a place of complete depletion then it does of partial depletion. So there's an asymmetry in the way this is done. So it's not as if you drink a glass of water. You fill the glass of water at a certain rate and it fills up to a certain level,",

                "transcript": "and it fills up to a certain level, and the rate is constant. Think about it as once the level of dopamine in your reserve is depleted past a certain point, it takes a lot more effort, much more sleep, much more NSDR, things of that sort to replenish that reservoir. Now, oftentimes what people will do when they start feeling less motivation is they will start relying on things like Adderall, Ritalin, some cases illegal substances that can increase dopamine. You know what those are. Please don't ever lean in to those. They are extremely dangerous. They really are because of their ability to potently release dopamine. And guess what, deplete that reservoir even further. We've talked about some supplements on the podcast that can replenish dopamine, L-tyrosine in particular. Mucuna pruriens is actually 99% l-DOPA, the precursor to dopamine. I don't necessarily recommend Mucuna pruriens. It tends to make people very dopaminergic-- drive, drive, drive, drive, motivated, and then crash. Again, depleting that pool. L-tyrosine is a little bit milder. But I really encourage people to lean first on the behavioral tools such as an NSDR. And by the way, there's a NSDR script, totally zero cost, that you can find by putting my name and NSDR into YouTube. That one works quite well if you are looking for a short NSDR. There are some other NSDRs. You can simply look on the internet or YouTube and just put NSDR and you'll find NSDR. Or if you prefer to do the more classic yoga nidra type approach, there are a lot of different yoga nidra options to choose from on YouTube. Many people think NSDR or yoga nidra are simply meditation with a body scan. That's not true. Meditation is a focus exercise. Most meditations are focus exercise. NSDR restores energy through the dopamine system, and newer data are starting to show that it can actually recover lost sleep, so if you're not sleeping enough. But to return to NSDR, a.k.a. yoga nidra, as a practice, yes, it's been shown in laboratory studies, in humans, by the way, to restore dopamine levels. There's another study, lesser known, from that same group that was published in 2011, which is entitled Dopaminergic stimulation enhances confidence and accuracy in seeing rapidly presented words. This was a cognitive task. They explored yoga nedra, a.k.a. NSDR, in the context of increasing striatal dopamine. They already knew that it did that, so that's great. They confirmed that result. But what they also found is that doing NSDR could restore confidence in cognitive ability and performance in these cognitive tasks. So this is a really powerful, zero cost tool for re-upping or replenishing that dopamine reserve. So this is something to do every day, especially when you're not feeling depleted. So the question, again, was about how",

                "transcript": "So the question, again, was about how to make sure that you don't go through these cycles of extreme motivation and then lesser motivation. Well, get your sleep right. I always say, 80% or more of the nights of your life, hopefully the nights that it's not good, are for good reasons that you're enjoying yourself. But hey, life happens, so 100% of the time it's just not reasonable to expect of yourself. Do NSDR once a day for either 10 minutes. If you have the time to do 20-30 minutes or an hour, you will see even more positive effects. It has been shown in these research studies to replenish dopamine, levels of confidence, cognitive ability, et cetera, and sense of motivation. And I said there were three tools, and the third tool that really can allow you to keep the dopamine, a.k.a. motivation circuitry, tuned up properly is to really start paying attention to peaks in dopamine and be very careful about layering in too many things that can stimulate the dopamine system. I talked about this quite a bit in the episode that we did on ADHD and building and maintaining focus. There are many things out there nowadays that will deplete the dopamine system. For instance-- and by the way, none of what I'm about to list is necessarily bad. I actually used some of these things. For instance, caffeine will increase dopamine receptors that will allow whatever dopamine is available to be more potent. OK, so caffeine is great for some people, less good for people with anxiety. Don't drink it too late in the day because it will interfere with your sleep, and so on and so forth. But many people will combine caffeine with music that they particularly like. Music's great. Music can stimulate dopamine release, we know this. It can enhance motivation, especially if is the kind of music that really puts you in the groove for the particular type of work you're going to do. For me, I like to listen to either loud fast music or Glenn Gould classical piano, so one or the other. I know what's right for me for a given time. You'll know what's right for you for a given time and your preferences. But what will happen is people will start consuming caffeine at higher and higher levels. Again, caffeine isn't necessarily bad, but they'll start doing that. And they'll start layering it in, or stacking, very potent music, potent for them, plus things like L-tyrosine. Again, none of these things are terrible on their own. In fact, they can be very beneficial. Sometimes they'll start taking Mucuna pruriens. Sometimes they'll start relying on things like Adderall, Ritalin. And pretty soon what's happening is they're getting these big waves in that dopamine wave pool, big peaks. And within a few days or maybe even within a few hours, they're depleted and they're at that low. And then, as Dr. Anna Lembke, who is a guest on the podcast, talked about in terms of addiction but also in her wonderful book Dopamine Nation, what happens is after those big peaks in dopamine, the reservoir, the baseline in dopamine, drops below its initial level. So it's as if the reservoir got deeper, and it's emptier, and it takes much, much longer to fill. So to be quite specific, what I'm recommending is get your sleep right. Ideally, every night of your life, but for as many nights of your life as possible. That's clearly replenishing dopamine and sense of motivation. Do all the things associated with that-- morning, sunlight, lack of artificial light at certain hours of the night, et cetera. All of that's in the Toolkit for Sleep and other episodes I mentioned before. Have a practice that is research supported to replenish dopamine, and incorporate that practice any time of day. Again, NSDR can be done morning, afternoon, or evening, or middle of the night if you wake up and you need to get back to sleep, it can be very beneficial for that. But do it as a consistent practice so that dopamine reservoir remains tapped off. And as a third point, please be wary of, or at least aware of,",

                "transcript": "And as a third point, please be wary of, or at least aware of, these peaks in dopamine and the fact that layering in a lot of things that stimulate dopamine, well, that can be wonderful for your wedding, birth of a new child, going to a sports event with a bunch of friends, celebrating a big anniversary. Yes, please do celebrate and enjoy the wonderful events of life, but please also understand and expect there will be a lull, a sort of postpartum low, maybe not full blown depression, that follows that unless you incorporate some tools and practices to replenish that dopamine. Does that mean you should never combine caffeine, L-tyrosine, music, and a workout, and time with friends? No, absolutely not. But don't expect to do that, and then go do an intense bout of work, and then get up the next morning and do it all over again for more than a few days before you find yourself pretty depleted. So rather than give you a specific schedule of do seven days of this and four days of this, what I encourage you to do is, for at least five days a week-- maybe give yourself some time off on the weekends, maybe not. But for at least five days a week, get into a consistent routine that is, I should say, neurobiologically consistent as well with how the dopamine, a.k.a. circuits that control motivation, work. And I assure you that you will find yourself in a more regular groove of focus, and attention, and alertness, and motivation when you need to. And provided you're doing all the things I described, and hopefully paying attention to other things like nutrition and social connection too, of course, you'll find a much more even pattern of motivation over time. One last thing before I conclude the answer to this question. When I was in graduate school, I got some wonderful advice from an excellent neurologist. His name is Robert Knight. He used to be at University of California, Berkeley. I think he's retired now but is still active in the scientific community. And I asked him what he was doing that weekend. I don't know why this came up. And he said, oh, I'm going fishing. I like mindless recreation. I said, that's great. You know, fishing is fun. I'm not particularly into fishing myself, but I've done it a few times and I enjoy it. And he said, the most important thing for a science or medicine career or any demanding career? I said, what? I was all ears, super hungry to get in the mix and do research and publish papers. And he said, figure out how many hours a day you can do real work consistently. That means five days a week, for some people six or seven, but five days a week I think for most people is going to be a bit healthier overall for your social life and family, et cetera. And he said, figure that out, and know that that number is what you should apply over, and over, and over again, but update that number about every four or five years. And I said, OK, so does that mean that over time I'm working more and more or less and less? And he said, ah, here's the deal-- as you get better at your profession, you will find that you can do more potent work, more directed work, in a shorter amount of time, but that does not mean that you can continue to expand the amount of time that you're doing focused work. In fact, the opposite. So this follows a sort of general principle that's also present in resistance training, weightlifting, right? The analogy there is that people always imagine that as you get better and better at resistance training that you should do more and more volume, just keep adding volume. And there's some evidence to support that. More volume for hypertrophy as opposed to less, et cetera. We've done episodes on this. However, there's a different school of thought that works exceedingly well, and it runs in the exact opposite direction, which is as you get better at controlling muscular contractions-- or let's say for in an endurance sport, as you get better at regulating your stride, and breathing, and all those things, you actually can do more \"adaptation\" stimulating damage during a given training session. So you want to train less not more over time because beginners don't actually have the ability to get much done in a lot of time or a short period of time, whereas, experts can come in there and really nail it. So I think that advice that Robert Knight was really key, and it's something that I've followed throughout my career. So at one period of my life, I won't mention the hours that I worked in graduate school, they were pretty insane to be honest. I had family members get a little concerned. I actually lived in the laboratory even as a junior professor. I don't suggest people do that by the way, but I enjoyed it at the time. And the key thing is that you figure out what you can do consistently and still maintain mental health and physical health. That's key as well. And do that, and then, every couple of years or so, update that, typically, by reducing the total amount of time that you're doing that high-potency work. I think that, combined with the other tools",

To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these ask me anything sessions, plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the Huberman Lab podcast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. Just to remind you why we launched the Huberman Lab podcast premium channel, it's really twofold. First of all, it's to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which, of course, will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length. We are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast. And to fund research. In particular, research done on human beings, so not animal models but on human beings, which I think we all agree as a species that we are most interested in. And we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance. And those protocols will be distributed through all channels. Not just the premium channel but through all channels-- Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. So the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now, and especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the tiny foundation has generously offered to do dollar-for-dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel. So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science related tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to sign up for the Huberman Lab premium channel, again, there's a cost of $10 per month, or you can pay $100 up front for the entire year. That will give you access to all the AMA's. You can ask questions and get answers to your questions, and you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well. There will also be some premium content such as transcripts of the AMA's and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman lab podcast episodes not found elsewhere. And again, you'll be supporting research for mental health, physical health, and performance. You can sign up for the premium channel by going to hubermanlab.com/premium. Again, that's hubermanlab.com/premium. And as always, thank you for your interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]",

So the typical thing that we hear these days is oh, you're so OCD, or he's so OCD, or she's so OCD, or I'm so OCD. Now if someone is OCD in that sense, OK, so not the clinical disorder but OCD in the sense that they're really clean, they're really fastidious, they need everything perfect. However, that person can achieve some level of calm and comfort that's fairly long lasting if everything's clean and perfect, well, then that's not obsessive compulsive disorder.

The entire website is searchable. But if you want to listen to that episode or watch that episode, you can access it hubermanlab.com. The question is in your discussion with Dr. Anna Lembke you were talking about abstaining from people's drug of choice for 30 days to reset the dopamine reward pathway. And indeed that is the prescriptive that Dr. Anna Lembke gives for most all addictions and for people that are suffering from milder even severe depression related to dopamine seeking behaviors, social media, video games, sex, food, et cetera. However, of course, in the instance of food or in some other addictions, you can't abstain for 30 days. That would be terrible to abstain for food for 30 days. I'm sure people have done it, but it is not healthy to do. Certain things like alcohol and drugs people can abstain for 30 days in efforts to never go back to them again. There are cases of severe alcohol or opiate dependence where people can't go cold turkey or they risk dying, so there they need to really work with a physician. But the 30-day reset of the dopamine system is something that's very real and that pertains to most people. That is it's going to be very effective for most people struggling with either behavioral, or what are sometimes called process addictions, or other types of addictions including substance abuse issues. The question continues. You said you were going to ask Ana how to abstain if your drug of choice is a thought or narrative as opposed to a substance or a behavior. The question continues, as far as I can tell, your discussion with Ana moved on before you asked her the question. Would you be able to discuss strategies for abstaining from addictive thoughts and narratives? OK. So let's talk about intrusive thoughts, and let's start off by asking ourselves, what is a thought?",

                "transcript": "and let's start off by asking ourselves, what is a thought? In the realm of neurobiology, we have sensations which are the processes by which our neurons, nerve cells convert light, photons, sound waves, touch, mechanical pressure, et cetera into electrical signals and chemical signals that head into our nervous system, including our brain. And then our brain, at least we think, make sense of them, and help us navigate the world that we're in. So the sensation part is a pure transformation of mechanical information, or in some cases, chemical information like smell. Literally, volatile chemicals floating around in the world are brought in through your nose and your neurons and your olfactory bulb convert those into electrical and chemical signals that your brain can understand. Perceptions are your idea of what those signals out in the world are. Either because you're paying attention to them, or for some other reason you decide that stop sign in front of you is red, and that the sign behind it is white, and that the sky is blue or cloudy, those are perceptions. So we have sensations and perceptions. Then we have emotions which are these things that include the mind and body that are related to neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, et cetera, although, those chemicals do other things as well. And then, of course, we have behaviors, actions. Everything from me moving my pen on a piece of paper to walking, running, et cetera. Thoughts are a fifth category of neural functioning that we really need to define, but that doesn't have as strict a definition as sensations, perceptions, or feeling, or action. But thoughts are real. We all know this. Thoughts are real, and one way that we can define thoughts is that thoughts are perceptions that include data from the past, present, or future, or combinations of past and present, or present and future, or future and past. I'm not trying to give an overly complicated definition here, but if we are going to answer a question about how to abstain from thoughts in a really direct and actionable way, we really need to address what our thoughts. So thoughts are perceptions that are generated internally.",

                "desc": "Strategies for dealing with intrusive thoughts that are repetitive but not disturbing.",
                "transcript": "So thoughts are perceptions that are generated internally. We don't need any external sensation in order to have a thought. We can close our eyes. We could be in sensory isolation for that matter. We could even be floating with no gravity, and we can have a thought. Thoughts tend to run pretty much automatically in the background all the time. Some people refer to this as chatter in the back of our minds in a very unstructured way. And then if we force our thoughts to be structured because we decide they need to be, or if something in our environment captures our perception, then our thoughts tend to be structured. Let me give you an example. If I'm just walking around, if there were a way in which we could broadcast my thoughts onto a screen, I hope we wouldn't do that. But those thoughts would be a mixture of semi-complete sentences and gibberish. However if somebody stops me, and says, hi. Good to see you. What are you doing today? And I start answering, well, then my thoughts are suddenly being driven by an external stimulus, their question, and some internal ideas, memory of who I am and what I'm doing that day so past and present, and so on. And so thoughts become structured. So when we have a question about how to abstain from thoughts, we need to be additionally specific and really pinpoint that what we're trying to do is to abstain from thoughts we don't want presumably, either because they are too repetitive and distracting, or because what's contained in those thoughts is disturbing. This is important because it gives us two answers to the questions that are highly divergent. One answer to the question of how to abstain from intrusive thoughts, thoughts that were addicted to, is if those thoughts are merely on loop all the time and we can't stop them, but the thoughts themselves aren't particularly disturbing. So think about a song you can't get out of your head, or you keep recounting some event, but the event itself isn't very disturbing. It's just intrusive because it's there. Well, in that case, the data really point to trying to anchor your thoughts to some external stimulus. So getting into action, getting into activities that really draw your attention away from that thought. Now you may still hear it scrolling in the background, so you might be sitting in class still hearing that loop of thoughts in the background. That's something that over time ought to wane, it ought to disappear if we try and bring more and more attention to whatever it is that's in our environment, whatever it is that we happen to be learning or doing physically, et cetera. Things like mindful meditation.",

                "desc": "Approaches to handle intrusive thoughts that are disturbing and potentially linked to trauma.",
                "transcript": "Things like mindful meditation. Doing a 10 or even just 5 minute a day practice of sitting with eyes closed, or lying down with eyes closed and really focusing on one's breath, focusing one's attention on sometimes called the third eye center, but in science we'd say just the region right behind the forehead, you're directing your attention there, has been shown to increase focus for singular topics and can improve memory and do a bunch of other things as well. Those are data from Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab at New York University. She was a guest on the podcast as well. My laboratory has run studies on mindful meditation as well. So what you're really trying to do is learn how to focus better on one thing, and by focusing on that one thing, you focus off these repetitive thoughts. Now, I have a feeling that this question was asked and that many people upvoted this question because the issue isn't just thoughts that are intrusive because they're there and on repeat, but because the thoughts themselves are actually troubling. This could be recounting a trauma, someone harmed you, you observed something that was disturbing, you felt wronged, you felt someone else was wronged, you can't seem to get your mind off of something, and your emotions tend to follow, and so it's uncomfortable. I have a feeling this is the root of the question. In that case, the approach is very different. What we know from essentially all of the quality scientific and clinical studies is that those sorts of intrusive thoughts are very much like a trauma. Now we have to be clear in defining what trauma is. I'll use the definition that Dr. Paul Conti, another incredible guest that was on our podcast. A Stanford-Harvard trained psychiatrist. I think one of the world's foremost leaders on the issue of trauma and psychiatry and psychology generally. He defines trauma as an event or something that fundamentally changes the way that your nervous system works such that you function less adaptively going forward from that event. So not every bad occurrence in your life is a trauma. That's good news. The bad news is many people have traumas, and traumas change the way that our nervous system works so that we don't function as well as we could. So in that sense, intrusive thoughts that are disturbing are in many ways traumas and are reinforcing that trauma. Now, we know that almost counterintuitively in order to deal with trauma, you have to get very close to that trauma. You don't have to reexpose, and I would hope you would not reexpose yourself to the very same trauma. But we know that one of the best ways to deal with traumas is to get very clear about the narrative around those traumas. Now this can be done with a therapist ideally, but not everyone has access to therapy or can afford therapy. There's a range of quality of therapists for that matter, so we're always referring to the desire for people to do great therapy with really great, meaning excellently trained people. But it turns out that if you want to extinguish an intrusive thought, one of the best ways to do that is to journal about that particular thought extensively. So rather than the earlier strategy for intrusive thoughts where they're just on loop, and intrusive because they're on loop and present, but their content isn't disturbing, when that thought is disturbing and intrusive, we know that it's very useful to script out as much detail about that particular thought and the things around it as possible. Now obviously, you want to do this in a way that is fairly structured. So you ideally would use complete sentences. So the reason for doing that is that thoughts, as I mentioned earlier, can often be fragmentary. So they pop up in our mind almost we seemingly spontaneously. They're inhibiting our ability to focus, or be present at work, or family, or other things, or sleep. Writing things down in a lot of detail does seem to have this quality of both reducing the emotional load of whatever it is that thought is about, as well as diminishing the frequency of those intrusive thoughts over time. So this is far and away different than the strategy I mentioned for the other types of intrusive thoughts. And really it's far and away different from the 30-day abstinence approach that Dr. Anna Lembke was talking about for substance or behavioral addictions. Now, of course, this process of abstaining from thoughts or removing the addictive nature of certain thoughts can definitely take some time. So a good example there would be superstitions. I'll come clean here, and I've talked about this before on a few podcasts that when I was in college, I developed a knock on wood superstition. Any time I'd say something that I didn't want to happen or did want to happen, I'd say, knock on wood, and I'd knock on wood. And then I started suppressing the behavior mostly because it was a little embarrassing. And then I started just telling myself in my head, knock on wood, knock on wood, knock on wood. And it was clearly a little bit of an OCD type thing, but again, OCD in air quotes here. I think it qualified as OCD in the sense that the more I did it, the more I wanted to do it. So I needed to go cold turkey on the thinking, but how can you go cold turkey on a thought? You couldn't. What I was told to do and what worked very well for me was to just write down the worst possible outcome",

                "transcript": "was to just write down the worst possible outcome that I was concerned about. So to really get close to the nature or the underlying basis of that intrusive thought. And I raise this because a lot of times the intrusive thought is not, OK, I'm thinking about a car accident, or I'm thinking about a breakup, or I'm thinking about an exam that I have. That can be intrusive, but a lot of times it's some kind of nebulous, abstract, set of words, or ideas, or images around something that happened that we saw or heard or experienced. And by putting a lot of clear structure to what the thought is exactly and to putting some thought and structure onto paper about what that pattern of not healthy thinking relates to, people often achieve tremendous relief in a fairly short amount of time. Sometimes just in one session of writing it down, sometimes they need to write it down multiple times. What you're essentially trying to do with a intrusive thought or a trauma of any kind is you're trying to turn a disturbing story, that is a story that evokes a lot of emotion and captures, it hijacks your nervous system, into what is essentially a known but repetitive and old, boring story where the emotional load has been depleted. And there are, of course, I have to highlight the fact that getting sufficient rapid eye movement sleep we also know is very important for removing the emotional load of traumatic experiences and intrusive thoughts. So you really want to strive to get the best possible sleep you can. That includes sufficient rapid eye movement sleep. And we have multiple zero-cost resources for that at hubermanlab.com. We have the episode on mastery or sleep. We have the episode on perfecting your sleep. We have the toolkit for sleep. All of which are time stamped and all of which can be accessed to completely zero cost to try and get your sleep as good as possible, including lots of rapid eye movement sleep. So in order to remove intrusive and addictive thoughts, ask yourself, is this OCD of the classic sense? If it is, you should see a psychiatrist. They won't necessarily prescribe medication, but there are tools for true OCD that are very effective in many cases. And we did the episode on OCD which I invite you to listen to as well. You want to ask yourself, are the thoughts disturbing or merely intrusive and repetitive? If they're merely intrusive and repetitive, well, then learning to focus your attention on other things and getting better at focusing on single things through an exercise like mindfulness, meditation can really help. And indeed perhaps the best use of mindfulness meditation is to improve your level of focus. It does have other benefits as well, but that's going to be the major one that one will experience even with these very short 5 or 10-minute day meditations. Great data on that from the scientific literature. And then if those intrusive thoughts are not only intrusive but they're also disturbing, in that case, you really want to put as much structure and thought, believe it or not, into what those thoughts are really about. Write them out on paper in complete sentences and maybe do that multiple times until the underlying emotions related to those thoughts really start to diminish. And by doing that, you're essentially doing your own form of trauma therapy, for lack of a better way to put it. And again, the data really point to the fact that getting close to the specific details around those intrusive thoughts is going to be the best way to extinguish them.

First of all, it's to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel which, of course, will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length. We are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast. And to fund research, in particular research done on human beings. So not animal models but on human beings, which I think we all agree is the species that we are most interested in. And we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance. And those protocols will be distributed through all channels. Not just the premium channel but through all channels, Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. So the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth, and allow you the opportunity to support the research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now an especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the Tiny Foundation has generously offered to do a dollar-for-dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel. So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science-related tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to sign up for the Huberman Lab Premium channel, again there's a cost of $10 per month, or you can pay $100 up front for the entire year. That will give you access to all the AMAs, you can ask questions and get answers to your questions, and you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well. There will also be some premium content such as transcripts of the AMAs and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman Lab podcast episodes not found elsewhere. And again, you'll be supporting research for mental health, physical health, and performance. You can sign up for the premium channel by going to hubermanlab.com/premium.

This is an unprecedented event in human history, as far as we know, because it wasn't until the advent of the smartphone that we've spent so much time looking at screens at close range relative to looking at things at further distances from our face throughout the day. In fact, it should come as no surprise that the incidence of myopia, of nearsightedness, is increasing dramatically around the world but is increasing particularly fast in children and in young adults and even in adults who are viewing things at very close range, so 2 and 1/2 feet or less.

However, if you want your vision to be maintained or even improve, it's going to be very important for you to view things at a distance as well for ideally several hours per day. Now, I realize some people just simply won't accomplish this. In fact, I'd like everyone to just take a moment and do a rough estimation in your head of how much time during your daytime activities you are viewing things at, say, 2 and 1/2 feet or 3 feet or less, so smartphone, computer screen, paper, books, et cetera, versus viewing things that are 4 feet away, 8 feet away, so maybe conversation across the table with another human being. Remember those? Some of us are doing that more now that we seem to be emerging from this whole pandemic phase. However, many people are still mostly just viewing things within very close range. And, in fact, if you were to ask yourself, how much time do you spend looking at things at the distance of many hundreds of feet, or taking a walk where you're not looking at any screen and you're simply letting visual images or the visual imagery rather pass by on your eyes, I think for most of us that number is getting progressively smaller and smaller with each passing year. So this is an issue because the structure of the eye is such that the lens of the eye can move, but also that the length of the eyeball from front to back is actually impacted by how close or how far you happen to view things during the course of your day, especially during development.",

It's also been performed on humans, where a visual occluder or a visual image. So an occluder is just a black screen or a piece of cardboard or an image, maybe some black and white checks or checkers, are placed at a certain distance from the eye, either up close or far away, and the impact of that on the length of the eyeball and on the structure of the lens and on the quality and acuity of vision is then measured. And to make a long story short, what these studies show is that, if during development, you or an animal exclusively looks at things that are up close, very close to the eye, and doesn't ever get long-range vision, the eyeball lengthens. And when that happens the lens, which, of course, is in the front of the eyeball, which focuses the light onto the back of the eyeball, which is where the so-called neural retina",

It lands too close or near the lens as opposed to on the back of the eyeball. And that's part of the reason what we call the consequence of that nearsighted myopia. In far sightedness, the opposite happens. The visual image is actually focused behind the retina. It doesn't land directly on the retina, which is what you want. It's focused too far behind the retina. And that's due to a shortening of the eyeball. So what I just described actually explains pretty well why kids who look at computer screens, or books up close often need glasses. When I was growing up, they called this nerd syndrome. Raising my hand for those of you that are listening. I read an awful lot, but I also spend time outside fortunately and running around on the soccer field and looking at things in the distance and playing in the neighborhood with my friends.",

Kids that spend the vast amount of their time looking at things up close, and particularly children who do that indoors for most of their waking time, well, those kids develop myopia. This is part of the reason why we have such an increase of the incidence of myopia nowadays. What's interesting, and I think most people don't realize, is that even as a young adult and adult, and perhaps even as an older adult, an elderly person, looking at things up close to much at the expense of getting some time viewing things at a distance, in particular outdoors, can be very problematic because it can exacerbate myopia. So the short, direct prescription here is to make sure that you're getting at least an hour or so each day, although ideally it would be more, of long viewing. And that could be done by walking outside and avoiding looking at your phone while walking. It doesn't require that you look at a particular object in the distance, although if you are scanning for and looking for objects in the distance, the way that you might on a hike or you're looking out toward or off a vista or you're looking for someone in the distance, all of that sort of visual scanning behavior is going to be very good for your eye health and for maintaining vision at a distance. If you're somebody who's far sighted",

                "transcript": "If you're somebody who's far sighted and you have trouble seeing things up close, well, then you need to ask yourself whether or not you're spending too much time looking at things off in the distance, although I want to be very clear that nearsightedness and farsightedness aren't necessarily the consequence of this near, far viewing. There can be independent causes of nearsightedness and farsightedness. But for many people out there who are spending progressively more and more time just looking at things up close, you can get this lengthening of the eyeball or challenges in the way that the elasticity of the lens is controlled by the musculature in ways that make it hard to maintain sharp, crisp vision when you're looking at things at a distance or up close. So I can't, because there are simply no studies to support the idea that you need exactly two hours per day of outside long vision at a particular distance and/or that you want to cut off or have a threshold of four hours per day of looking at things up close, but we can say with a high degree of confidence that if you want to maintain or enhance your vision at all distances, that for every hour or so that you spend looking at things, say, a distance of 3 feet away or less, that you want to get at least one hour per day total, doesn't have to be all at once, of looking at things out in the distance or looking at things beyond 3 feet relative to the distance from your eye. So I think for some people who are already badly myopic, this isn't going to remedy that myopia. You're still going to need corrective lenses, but if you're somebody, similar to the person who asks the question, that they're quote unquote \"noticing\" their vision is deteriorating, really try and balance out the amount of viewing that you're doing at close distance and long distance. And, again, I would not obsess about the total numbers. It doesn't have to be three hours and three hours, but the more time that you can spend at viewing things that variable distance throughout the day, the better off you're going to be in maintaining and perhaps even enhancing your vision somewhat.

                "transcript": "Now, there's an additional behavioral tool that we can glean from the recent scientific literature exploring myopia which points to the fact that children who get two hours a day or more of time outside in sunlight-- one of my favorite topics. I know many people are probably rolling their eyes right now when they hear me say you really want to view morning sunlight, not through a window or windshield. Don't wear sunglasses for that, trying to get as much sunlight as you can in your eyes early in the day. Never stare at any light so bright it's painful, look at, et cetera. We've done a lot of episodes on this. We have a Light for Health episode, this Isn't All the Sleep episodes. It's just such a basic foundation of circadian rhythm and health that I just keep repeating it. However, there are also large-scale clinical trials involving thousands of subjects that have shown that people, children in particular, who get two hours or more of outside time every day have a much lower incidence of myopia. Now, what's really interesting about these studies is that, while some of those kids are looking at things further off in the distance than they would if they were indoors on their tablets or screens or with their nose in a book, it does not seem to be the case that they have to be looking at things in the distance in order to see this reduced incidence of myopia. What's probably happening instead is that the particular wavelengths of light that emanate from the sun, that photon energy in particular is triggering the activation of the so-called intrinsically sensitive melanopsin and retinal ganglion cells, which we know are important for setting circadian rhythm for enhancing mood focus and alertness during the day and enhancing the quality and duration of sleep at night. But those melanopsin and intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells are also involved in networks within the eye that relate to blood flow, that relate to the ciliary body, which is a structure within the eye that controls the aperture and movement of some key components within the eye, that also relate to the crispness of vision, that is the acuity of vision, at both short and long range. So there are a lot of technical details there. In fact, I really hope to get the great Russell Van Gelder, or Dr. Russell Van Gelder, who's the chair of ophthalmology at the University of Washington in Seattle, who is a world expert in this and the various aspects, both molecular and structural of the ciliary body and the lens, and he's an expert in uveitis, a very interesting topic in its own, to come onto the podcast and talk more about eye health.

Meanwhile, if the first behavioral protocol for enhancing and maintaining eye health is to make sure that you're spending at least some time balancing out the near vision and far vision during the day, it also stands to reason that you want to get outside for at least two hours a day, which I know sounds like a lot, in order to prevent myopia, if you're a young person, and offset the progression of and maybe even reverse some myopia, we don't know yet based on the data, but there's some indication that's possible, by getting outside two hours a day. And the cool thing is, because many people, including myself, have a lot of work to do and we need to be on our phones quite a lot, or we choose to be on our phones quite a lot, this effect of getting sunlight outdoors during the daytime for two hours or more does not seem to require that you stay off your phone or tablet, or that you're looking at things far in the distance the entire time. What this means is, if you can get outside onto a patio or a deck or an outdoor table if you can, if weather and conditions permit, and do some of your phone time and computer time and reading, et cetera, outdoors. Now, if you're already making an effort to get outside, hike, play sports, take walks, et cetera, that of course counts towards this two hour threshold. And I know this sounds like a lot, this two hours, and yet for most people, it certainly will vary, depending on time of year, but I think striving to get on average about two hours of outdoor time as much as you can or opening a window, which wouldn't be as good as getting outside, but opening a window and trying to get some natural light exposure to the eye to trigger the activity, these intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin and retinal ganglion cells, that's going to be a really good idea in trying to offset and maybe even reverse some vision loss.

And actually, the lens of the eye has its own flexibility. It's a really, really interesting structure. I'll geek out on this far too long if I don't prevent myself from doing so, but the lens is just incredible. The fact that it has a specific structure of proteins like crystallines and things of that sort and that it can still derive nourishment from blood flow but does not actually have vasculature within it. So it's not-- if you notice the lens of your eyes and filled with blood vessels and capillaries because it needs light to pass through, super interesting structure I think the only violation of what I just said is the manatee. Those pigs are underwater, elephant-like creatures that I think were or are endangered. Down in Florida, they were getting chopped up by speedboats, but I think now there's some effort to preserve those big gentle giants. The manatee, as I recall, has a vascularized lens, which is why their eyes look opaque. It looks like they have cataracts. In any case, you're not a manatee. You have no blood vessel supply to the lens. Keeping that lens clear is vital nowadays. They can do lens replacement. There's really a pretty incredible progress in the realm of ophthalmology and surgical replacement of the lens or the cornea, other aspects of the eye. But if you're somebody who is interested in maintaining your vision, you're going to want to maintain the musculature that controls the movement and the change of shape in that lens and the movement of the eyes, which allows you to transition your vision from very sharp when viewing things up close to very sharp one viewing things at a distance. And this is where some of the so-called near-far exercises can be very useful. So when we did a full length podcast on eye health and improving eyesight, which I invite you to listen to if you like, talked about two different types of vision exercises that have been shown to be useful for improving vision at a level of acuity that have a lot to do with improving the musculature and the movement of the eyes and the lens. And that's what's called a smooth pursuit task. So you could go on to YouTube if you like and put smooth pursuit eye task and do this for a few minutes each day if you're trying to keep your vision strong. And what that task involves is, as the name suggests, smoothly tracking a small dot or crosshatch or arrow on the screen, which is very different than the so-called saccade type eye movements",

                "transcript": "than the so-called saccade type eye movements that we often make. Saccades are when you dart your eyes to a particular location to look at something that dart it to another location to look at something. Microsaccades are little, tiny versions of those that were doing most all of the time, believe it or not. When you look at a visual scene or image, if you did not have those little microsaccades, your brain would adapt or would attenuate to whatever you were looking at, and the visual image would actually disappear, which really speaks to how important it is that your perceptions change in order to maintain them. This is very similar to where if something is placed on your hand, say a finger, you'll notice that change, but then if you leave it there for a short while, you'll forget that it's there because the cells there have adapted out. There's no change. So your nervous system is largely responding to change. This is also why when you walk into a room and you'll often notice a novel smell, let's hope it's a good smell, after a few minutes or so, you don't notice the smell anymore because your olfactory system adapted that away. So a lot of that adaptation is prevented by those little microsaccades. And the macrosaccades, the bigger saccades, are really for moving your eyes around to look for things in visual space. Smooth pursuit is a very particular kind of visual behavior that you can do in a smooth pursuit task and zero cost. Costs a little bit of time I suppose to do this on YouTube. And most any of them will do. We can provide a link in the show note captions of one that we like or several that we like, but by doing that smooth pursuit task for a bit each day, maybe just a minute or two, you're maintaining your ability through the musculature of the eye to do smooth pursuit. And, of course, you do smooth pursuit when you move about your day, but for people that are trying to offset or reverse vision loss, doing some additional deliberate smooth pursuit exercises can be useful. The other visual exercise that can be very useful is the so-called near-far exercise. So this is best accomplished, I think, by holding out a pen or pencil in front of your eyes, in front of your head, and focusing very intensely through what's called a vergence eye movement, where you bring both eyes to the tip of the pen and then moving that pen closer and closer and closer to your eyes, where you get close enough that you actually have to deliberately bring your eyes-- for those of you listening, this is what I'm doing right now-- to the point where it's blurry and you can no longer hold it in sharp, crisp relief. You can't see it sharply that is. And then you can move it out a little bit distance and play right around that threshold where it's hard to keep it in focus and then move it back out again. And then in doing that for even a minute or two, you'll find is a bit of a strain on your eyes, but you can actually build up the musculature and the neuromuscular connections that allow you to do that more efficiently. And that has been shown to improve certain aspects of vision, especially when people are diligent about doing those exercises, not necessarily every day, but let's say three days a week or so. They can be very fast. I actually find them fun for reasons that escape me entirely. Now, how close you can bring that object",

All those things will dictate the exact performance of that task, but nonetheless, it's a very useful task to do when trying to maintain or improve vision. Now, of course, there are a lot more behavioral tools that one could use to maintain or enhance vision. I'm really touching on the biggest and what I consider the most important ones that are most accessible to people without the need for any fancy equipment at all.

That could be a very lengthy conversation, but let's just summarize it with a few brief points that we know stand based on the clinical and scientific research. We've all heard that carrots are good for your eyes. Well, it's not carrots per se that are good for your eyes. It's vitamin A that's essential for the so-called phototransduction cascade. The phototransduction cascade is the process by which the photoreceptors, which are in the back of the retina, at least if you're human, they're in the back of the retina, take photons, light energy, and convert it into electrical signals that's then conveyed to the other cells and neurons within the retina and then passed into the brain to create visual perceps. Most people can't get enough of this fat soluble vitamin, we call vitamin A, by making sure that they eat at least some dark green leafy vegetables. And that they do that in their closest to raw form, maybe cooked a little bit but not overly cooked. There are other sources of vitamin A out. There you can look those up online just for sources of vitamin A. Most people will be able to get enough vitamin A from their nutrition and won't require it from a supplement, provided that it's not present at excessively high levels in a foundational supplement or vitamin mineral supplement. Getting some additional vitamin A from a foundational supplement or vitamin mineral supplement is probably not going to be an issue unless you really take in far too much of that vitamin A. It could potentially provide some insurance. But, again, I think most people can get enough vitamin A from their diet if they are taking carrots or to eat the foods that contain vitamin A, green leafy vegetables being one. The other food that's known to be highly enriched in vitamin A is liver, one of my least favorite foods regardless of what animal that liver comes from. Liver is somewhat of a popular/controversial organ meat in the nutrition space for reasons that aren't interesting, for sake of this discussion anyway I suppose for those of you that like liver, you could eat a little bit of liver every once in a while. It is rich in a number of things that are beneficial to health, although for you vegans out there, I'm sure you'll want to avoid liver entirely. I avoid liver because I just simply don't like the way it tastes. Maybe once or twice I've tasted liver that was appetizing to me. And it can be OK, but it's just not, or at least by my read it, can be OK, but it's not a food that I actively seek out, order, or prepare for myself on a regular basis. So fortunately, there are other sources of vitamin A as well. And, again, I just invite you to all put into a web search food sources of vitamin and figure out how to get your daily dose of vitamin A by taking in foods that you like for you. And then in terms of supplementation of things that can enhance vision, this is a newer area. And frankly, it's an area where most of the data point to some supplements that can potentially be beneficial in certain disease conditions. So for instance, in fairly progressed age-related macular degeneration. Age-related macular degeneration is fairly common, or more common than we would like, we should say. And it does appear that supplementing with certain things like lutein, which is present in eggs, or egg yolks in particular, especially egg yolks that aren't overly cooked, or that can be supplemented can potentially help with some instances of age-related macular degeneration. But the data on this are still emerging. I consulted with our chair of ophthalmology at Stanford about lutein and some of the other things that you'll see out there, like zeaxanthin and astaxanthins. And these xanthins come from certain fruits like blueberries, and they're present in supplements and things of that sort. The consensus I got talking to him and talking to some other ophthalmologists are that if you're really aiming to get a healthy diet, you're avoiding cigarette smoking. And by healthy diet I mean getting sufficient amounts of vitamin A and lutein through food sources. Again, you can look up where those food sources are, egg yolks just being one of them. Well, then chances are you're not going to need to supplement with lutein or the zeaxanthins or the astaxanthins. However, I have heard anecdotal reports from a number of people that they'll start taking a supplement for eye health, there are a number of them out there-- we are not, as a podcast, affiliate with any of those eye health supplements by the way-- and people are reporting enhanced vision. I receive emails all the time that say, I'm taking this lutein at 20 milligrams per day, and there I should mention that the dosage that's been explored in a couple of studies is 10 to 20 milligrams per day. Again, you could get that from foods. You could go above that if you're more cavalier, or you could go toward the lower end of that, 10 to 20 milligrams per day, if you are somebody who's more conservative. I should say. Well, there aren't people out there who are, looking at lutein, they think it's fairly safe, and they're taking higher dosages of lutein, so 20 to 30 milligrams per day. They're also taking supplements that contain zeaxanthins and astaxanthins and are reporting anecdotally that their vision is enhanced. I don't dispute those claims, but as of now, there aren't many papers, I could only find about 4, 3 really solid ones and then a fourth, that point to the specific disease instances where supplementing with lutein, zeaxanthin, or astaxanthin can be beneficial for slowing the progression of things like advanced onset age-related macular degeneration. And the degree of offset for that macular degeneration was slight. It wasn't enormous, but it was robust enough that it warranted reporting in the paper. Or things like Lieber's, which is a particular eye disease. It impacts a whole different set of systems in the eye. So basically, what I'm trying to say is, when it comes to supplements to support eye health, make sure you're getting enough vitamin A from your diet. If you're not, consider supplementation or consider changing your diet somewhat to make sure you can get that lutein and vitamin A. And if you are interested in it, and it's within your budget, I don't know of any evidence that supplementing with additional lutein, zeaxanthin, and astaxanthin can be dangerous at all. So for those of you that are really interested in maintaining or improving your vision, that might be an area that you want to explore. I personally am not taking lutein, zeaxanthin, or astaxanthin, at least not at this time. I do take a foundational supplement, which is my source of vitamin A in addition to my food sources. But I don't suffer from vision loss anywhere, readers at night, and I have for a long time. I have a little bit of a muscular weakness in one of my eyes that originated in childhood. So occasionally, if I get very fatigued, one of my eyes will deviate a little bit, a little bit of almost strabismus, especially if I've been awake for very long periods of time. It tends to recover once I get a good night's sleep. Some of you that have experienced this, where you have one eye that might just drift a little bit. I could do this for the camera if you want. OK, this is weird. I used to do this to my sister across the table when we were at a friend's houses for dinner. So I can actually move one of my eyes in like this, which actually just reflects that there's a extraocular muscle closer to my nose. It's rather weak, which allows me to do that. I can't do it so well with the opposite eye. Anyway, now I need to blink to clear my vision. But the point is that, if you're somebody who has a slightly deviating eye, slightly, often if you go to the ophthalmologist or optometrist, they're going to give you a prism lens which is going to redirect the image onto that slightly deflected eyeball. One thing you'll really want to discuss with that ophthalmologist or optometrist is whether or not there are exercises that you could do to overcome that issue without the need for a prism because what I saw and what many other people see when they put on a prism lens is that indeed it can line up their vision or their visual perception better, but indeed, it can lead to progressive weakening of the muscle further and further. So then that eyeball starts to deviate further and further. And that raises a larger question, which is, should we wear corrective lenses? In fact, if you go online, you'll find or hear about these examples of people that stopped wearing their corrective lenses, their glasses or contacts, in order to bring their vision back or improve their vision on their own. Now, if your vision is quite impaired, you're going to need corrective lenses or contacts. However, there are a number of people out there who find that if their vision is somewhat impaired, that forcing themselves to view things at a distance to do smooth pursuit, to do near far, and to make sure that they're getting adequate nutrition and things of that sort, can all sum to help offset some of the visual impairment that would occur if they were to just pop glasses on their face and rely on the corrective lenses in order to focus the light onto the correct area within the eye onto the neural retina. So I'm not telling people to throw off or get rid of their corrective lenses and contacts, but you can be overly reliant on these things, like a crutch, in a way that perhaps you want to do a little bit of work to try and overcome and then maybe work with a weaker prescription. And certainly, in the case of prism lenses, what I mentioned before is a real consideration. It's one I'm very familiar with. So as a last but I think very important and exciting feature of visual improvement is red light. I talked a little bit about this on the episode of the Huberman Lab podcast all about light and health. There's some really spectacular, I think I consider it spectacular, many other people consider it spectacular, research out of University College London. And the work I'm referring to is Glenn Jeffrey's work. I've known Glenn for a long time. These are animal studies, and now two human studies, exploring how exposure to red light early in the day can offset some of the vision loss related to age-related macular degeneration, or simply age-related visual decline. There's a whole mechanism here that's discussed in that episode, but it has to do with the fact that red light and near-infrared light, together, or maybe even separately, when viewed for even just a minute to 3 minutes once, or maybe two or three times per week maximum, can actually reduce the number of what are called reactive oxygen species in the photoreceptors that convert photons into electrical signals the rest of the visual system can understand. So that's a mouthful. Basically what they found was, for people 40 years or older, if they viewed this red light at a distance of about a foot and a half, although I wouldn't get too specific with this, for a few minutes each week total, they were able to offset some of the vision loss within a particular domain of vision. And I don't have time to go into the details here because I do that in the Light for Health episode, but you have different types of photoreceptors, cones, and rods. You have different types of cone photoreceptors that respond to different wavelengths of light, short, medium, and long wavelengths of light so-called blue, green, and red cones, they're sometimes called. When these people who are 40 years or older viewed red light on a consistent basis early in the day, and it did have to be early in the day, there was a real circadian effect there, there was a offset of some of the vision loss that would normally occur in a particular wavelength of light range that resulted in better visual acuity overall. So if you're very concerned about your vision, or you're into red light therapies, et cetera, there are a number of different red light devices out there. At some future point, the Huberman Lab podcast may partner with one of these red light companies. So right now, I'm not going to mention any of them in particular. They're prominent online. What you're looking for is a red light unit that provides red light and maybe far-- near infrared-- excuse me-- light as well. So something in the 650 to 720 ish nanometer range. So really it's going to look red or almost invisible to you if it's really far into the infrared. And you'll want to view that at a distance of about a foot and a half to 2 feet. And you don't want it to be so bright that it's painful to look at because you don't want to damage your eyes. But that's essentially what they used in these studies from the Jeffrey lab. And they showed some pretty impressive offset of some of the aspects of vision loss in these people 40 and older. So that's an area that you may want to explore as well, especially for folks 40 and older. And, again, this red light exposure had to be done early in the day. So hopefully, that collection of behavioral tools near, far, smooth pursuit, some of the discussion about lutein, nutrition, vitamin A, supplementation, zeaxanthins, astaxanthins, getting two hours of light exposure outside, sunlight exposure, get outside to do some of your work, and perhaps even deliberate red light exposure for certain people can be used to offset your concerns and your action potential vision loss and maybe even improve your vision regardless of what age you are. Everything I described is supported from the Peer-reviewed literature. And, again, if you want to get the deep dive on mechanism and further information about dosages, please check out the episode on eyesight and improving your eyesight and the Light for Health episode again at hubermanlab.com. Thank you for joining for the beginning of this Ask Me Anything episode. To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these Ask Me Anything sessions, plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the Huberman Lab podcast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. Just to remind you why we launched the Huberman Lab podcast premium channel, it's really twofold. First of all, it's to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which, of course, will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length. We are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast, and to fund research, in particular research done on human beings, so not animal models but on human beings, which I think we all agree is the species that we are most interested in. And we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance. And those protocols will be distributed through all channels, not just the premium channel but through all channels, Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. So the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions, in depth, and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the tiny foundation has generously offered to do dollar-for-dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel. So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science-related tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to sign up for the Huberman Lab Premium channel, again, there's a cost of $10 per month, or you can pay $100 up front for the entire year. That will give you access to all the AMAs. You can ask questions and get answers to your questions, and you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well. There will also be some premium content such as transcripts of the AMAs and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman Lab podcast episodes and not found elsewhere. And, again, you'll be supporting research for mental health, physical health, and performance. You can sign up for the premium channel by going to hubermanlab.com/premium. Again, that's hubermanlab.com/premium. And as always, thank you for your interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]",

And I suppose a related question is, should you even do deliberate, cold exposure if you have a sniffle, a cold, or a flu? I get that question all the time as well. So answer both of those questions. And I will also touch on some of the immune enhancing effects of deliberate cold exposure. But just to make sure that we answer the specific question asked here right off the bat, is it possible to get a cold or to get sick from deliberate cold exposure? Well, assuming that you're not doing the deliberate cold exposure for more than, say five or six minutes at one stretch, probably not directly from the deliberate cold exposure. I mention that because most people are doing anywhere from about a minute to three minutes, sometimes five or six minutes. And maybe for those of you that are really pushing it, 10 minutes of deliberate cold exposure. And most often after doing that deliberate cold exposure, people are either getting clothed, or they're getting into a sauna, or they're taking a hot shower, and then getting clothed and heading off into their day or off to sleep depending on what time of day or night you happen to do your deliberate cold exposure. We can safely say that if you warm up",

If you are somebody who is not accustomed to it, don't jump right up to that long exposure to cold water. Start with shorter exposures. But if you're doing that one-to-10-minute deliberate, cold exposure, and then you're getting warm afterwards and heading about your day, I can't see how the deliberate cold exposure itself would enhance your susceptibility to getting sick. That said, we know from an enormous number of studies that have looked at cold virus transmission and other forms of viral and bacterial transmission that the environment that you happen to be in does impact your susceptibility to colds and other types of viruses and to bacterial infections in the following way. There have been controlled studies in which people",

Those laboratories have rooms, which they can very tightly control the humidity, so essentially, the water content in the air, as well as the temperature in the room. And if you look at the total mass of those data, we can say a couple of specific things in kind of bullet point fashion. First off, cold, dry air does seem to increase our susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections. Because whether or not you're a mouth breather or a nose breather, and by the way, I suggest everyone be a nose breather unless you're exercising hard enough that you have to breathe through your mouth, or you're talking or something of that sort. But if you're a nose breather or a mouth breather or both, viruses and bacteria enter through your nose and mouth, sometimes through your eyes, but your nose and mouth are going to be the main sites of entry and your main barriers to viral and bacterial infections. In fact, one of the ways you are constantly fighting off bacterial and viral infections that you're exposed to all the time is by way of those viruses and bacteria getting trapped in the mucous lining of your nose or your mouth, most notably in the back of your throat. So if you spend time in cold, dry environments, there is a tendency for that mucosal lining to be thinner. There is a tendency for that mucosal lining",

                "transcript": "There is a tendency for that mucosal lining to not be as robust in general. And when I say robust, what I mean is that if your mouth breathing, for instance in a cold, dry environment, I'm thinking from the time I spent in Cambridge, Massachusetts in winter at the T station. If you're I'm just imagining myself because it was so darn cold back there breathing through your mouth or having gone for a run, and your mouth isn't covered, or even if you're deliberately nasal breathing, you are drying out your nasal passages and making them more susceptible to infections. Does that necessarily mean that every time you go out in cold, dry air that you're going to get an infection? No, of course it doesn't. But to relate this back to the question we have before, there are a lot of data pointing to the fact that more humid, warm environments are going to make your mucosal lining and the general upper respiratory area more, I don't want to say immune because I don't want to conflate that word with the other meaning of immune. It's going to make it more robust against bacterial and viral infections. So if you get into a cold shower or a cold plunge or a cold ocean or a cold lake, and then you get out, and you're out there shivering and shaking, trying to boost your metabolism or whatever it is that you're doing it for, and it's cold, dry air, and especially if your mouth breathing in that cold, dry air, yes, I could see how that might lead to a higher probability of getting a cold or other type of infection.

We're not talking about bacterial infections of cuts on the skin, et cetera. We're talking about colds and other forms of being sick, namely upper respiratory infections. OK, now with that said, I often get asked whether or not for people who already have a little sniffle, they're feeling a little run down or perhaps a lot run down, should they do deliberate cold exposure? And what's a little tricky to give a one size fits all answer, , but I think we can safely say that if you are feeling malaise, if you're feeling like you have to rest you're tired, you're not feeling good because of a cold or because of a flu or because of a bacterial infection, now, I'm not saying just feeling not good, I'm saying feeling not good due to a cold or other form of virus or bacterial infection, then I would say stay out of deliberate, cold exposure. Don't use it. Now, why would I say that? Given the data I'll talk about in a few minutes showing that regular deliberate cold exposure if done correctly, can in fact increase immune system markers and perhaps even make you much more robust to combating different types of infection through the release of adrenaline. We'll talk about what all that looks like in a moment in terms of protocols and some of the science.",

There, I, would instead recommend warmer hot baths warmer hot showers, the sauna, et cetera. But I also would caution that if you are getting into saunas that are too hot, saunas they're so hot that it's stressful for you, and again, a lot of people use deliberate heat exposure because of the stress it induces, they're doing some heat induced, for instance, heat shock proteins and different ways of increasing heart rate. That's a different sort of thing. That's hard, stressful in order to generate an adaptation. I don't recommend doing that. In fact, I don't recommend doing deliberate cold exposure, exercise, or deliberate heat exposure if you're feeling really not well. Now, if you're feeling just a little bit not well, you're feeling a little bit rundown, a little bit of sniffle, a little bit of malaise, well then, it's kind of an edge case where we could say, all right you know what? Just take a hot shower and go to sleep. That's probably the best advice, that good old-fashioned advice. But if you are determined to do your deliberate cold exposure anyway, then I would say definitely get warm or take a hot shower afterwards, hot bath, or hot sauna, but, not too hot that it's stressful, of course. And keep in mind that one of the variables that's been measured quite a lot in laboratory studies of deliberate cold exposure is the increase in immune system markers.

But it's very clear that deliberate cold exposure can increase the release and the production of different immune molecules and immune cells. One slightly older study, but nonetheless a good study that has relevance here is entitled \"Immune system of cold exposed and cold adapted humans.\" Keep in mind that this study is a little bit extreme. And there are reasons for that. I guess to make a long story short, oftentimes, in order to quote unquote \"see an effect in a study,\" scientists will use conditions that are pretty extreme compared to control group. Oftentimes, you'll see a dose response to, but it's a little bit trickier to do with human studies of deliberate, cold exposure. It can be done, but not too common. But here, they used a pretty what I would call extreme stimulus. It was exposing people to 14 degrees Celsius water, so that's 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit, which isn't that cold. It's like cool, I would say very cool water, but not what you might consider cold depending on how well you tolerate cold. And that will vary, of course. But they had people exposed to that for an hour, which is a pretty long time. Most people, as I mentioned, are using colder temperatures of deliberate cold exposure, so even high 30s, low 40s, maybe upper 40s for anywhere from one to 10 minutes, depending on how conditioned they are. And again, don't just jump into 10 minutes of deliberate, cold exposure, please at 35 degrees or 40 degrees or even 45 degrees if you aren't familiar with deliberate cold exposure.

Go to the Menu, go to Newsletter, and you can find that. We've done several episodes on deliberate cold exposure. In any event, this study, \"Immune system of cold exposing cold adapted humans,\" as I mentioned, had people in 14 degrees Celsius water for one hour. And basically what they found is that one exposure to cold did not change immune system function in any kind of significant way. However, what they found was if people did deliver cold exposure repeatedly over a period of about six weeks, and by repeatedly, I mean three times per week, what they found were trends. And again, trends are not statistically significant, but trends towards increases in plasma concentrations of things like IL 6, interleukin 6 or total numbers of T lymphocytes and T helper cells and T suppressor cells and activated T and B lymphocytes, these are all immune cells and immune molecules that roughly correspond to an increase in immune system function. If you'd like to learn more about the immune system, I did an episode on immune system function. Again, you can find that at hubermanlab.com. And it spells out the basic cell types of what's called the innate and the adaptive immune system. This study, which we will link to in the show note captions is but one study of several other studies showing that deliberate cold exposure can increase immune system markers, especially when deliberate cold exposure is done repeatedly over time, so in this case, three times a week over a period of six weeks. But again, I want to highlight these aren't highly significant effects. These are trends in the direction of increased numbers of immune cells and immune markers. Now, what's impossible to know is how those trends translate to actual resistance to specific concentrations of, say cold virus or flu virus or any other virus or bacteria. That would be great, but that's a very difficult study to do, especially in the context of deliberate cold exposure as well. Now, we can all be scientists about this and say, what is it",

And there, we can confidently say the molecules epinephrine and norepinephrine, which are released in both brain and body in response to cold water exposure, as well as things like deliberate hyperventilation, the release of norepinephrine and epinephrine into the brain and body is known to have a number of different effects related to the immune system. It can be pro-immune, at least in the short term. And in the long term, meaning if noradrenaline and adrenaline, again those are just different names for norepinephrine and epinephrine. I'm sorry, those are the same thing, but that's why I use them interchangeably so that you don't get confused. If you see noradrenaline or norepinephrine, that's the same thing you hear, epinephrine or adrenaline, same thing. Deliberate cold exposure or deliberate hyperventilation will increase those molecules, norepinephrine and epinephrine. And their increase is pro-immune. It can trigger the activation of immune cells and immune molecules that can make you more resistant to certain forms of infection. However, if norepinephrine and epinephrine are elevated chronically, and especially if they are elevated late in the day repeatedly over many, many days, that can cause reductions in the number and efficiency of immune cells in combating infections. So getting cold in this context of whether or not you can get sick from it should really be considered more as what happens when you spike your adrenaline and norepinephrine?

But really, that just translates to cyclic hyperventilation. So this is inhaling through nose, exhaling through the mouth repeatedly 25 times or so. [BREATHING] If you do that, you notice you feel quite warm, lots to do with some things relate to vasodilation, has some things to do with release of norepinephrine. And epinephrine, we know that pattern of deliberate hyperventilation, much like deliberate cold exposure, deploys or releases noradrenaline and adrenaline into your brain and body. And we know from this study entitled \"Voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system and attenuation of the innate immune response in humans\" showed really nicely, I think. That if people are injected with E. coli, a bacteria it's actually an end-- they did this through endotoxin injections. People got really sick. They'd get feel like they had the flu, they vomit, diarrhea, get a fever, et cetera. However if they did the sorts of breathing that I talked about just a moment ago, prior to that, they were able to ward off a lot of the symptoms associated with the endotoxin infection. And you would say, OK wow, their immune system just fired up, and they were able to fight it off. But it's trickier than that, actually. What happened was the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine from cyclic hyperventilation, which is really what [BREATHING] really is, cyclic hyperventilation, also called Wim Hof breathing, also called tummo breathing, et cetera, that actually had a suppressive action on certain arms of the immune system in a way that allowed people to avoid symptomology such as fever, nausea, et cetera. And we would imagine the same thing would occur with deliberate cold exposure done prior to bacterial infection or viral exposure. So if you're sensing that I'm saying two things at once, I am. I'm saying deliberate cold exposure, and cyclic hyperventilation can both cause deployment of molecules such as epinephrine and norepinephrine that lead to enhanced immune system function if done repeatedly. I'm also saying that increasing norepinephrine and epinephrine too much can suppress your immune system. In this study, the PNAS study that I mentioned a moment ago, that suppression of the immune response was actually one of the reasons people avoided symptomology. But they were still injected with endotoxin, so they just weren't fighting off the endotoxin with fever. Remember, fever is an adaptation to fight infection. It's designed essentially to heat up the infection and kill it. So what are we to take away from this? Here are what I think are the key takeaways.",

                "transcript": "Here are what I think are the key takeaways. One, if you are feeling good to great, do your deliberate cold exposure. And perhaps don't worry so much about using your body's natural metabolism and thermogenic abilities to heat back up afterwards. But I don't suggest anyone ever allow themselves to stay really cold after deliberate cold exposure for more than 10, 15 minutes or maybe half an hour, right? Get bundled back up, or put on clothes. If it's a nice hot, sunny day, get out in the sun and warm up. Again, temperatures and conditions will vary for different people, different locations, et cetera. If you are not feeling great, you're feeling a little rundown, and you really want to do your deliberate cold exposure, do it, but then warm up really well afterwards. Maybe even drink some hot tea or other fluid afterwards as well. And if you are not feeling good, you're feeling malaise, you're feeling run down. Despite what you read about deliberate, cold exposure or cyclic hyperventilation, allowing for the deployment of immune molecules or increasing the number of immune cells that you're making, avoid anything that's stressful or challenging whether or not it's a cold challenge, a heat challenge, or an exercise challenge when you're feeling run down. Because under those conditions, what you really want to do is slow your circulation down, probably find and take a little walks or something provided you're not doubled over in bed and vomiting, and things like that. A little bit of movement, probably good to circulate your blood. But in general, the advice that you get to rest when you're sick and not push yourself, that's really good advice because you want all of your body's resources to be devoted to getting over that infection. And if you're interested in sickness and sickness behavior and the sorts of behaviors that can combat infection, check out the episode I did on the immune system. We'll link to it in the show note captions. Because it talks about how when we have a viral or bacterial infection, a whole set of brain circuits get activated that encourage us to be more in the fetal position, to move less, to be eyes down, to kind of slump down. That's not a coincidence. That's because of the activation of these so-called sickness circuits that are really designed to help you heal yourself. So I both apologize, and what do the kids say? Sorry, not sorry. Don't apologize for the somewhat nuanced answer here. Because a lot of information out there says, oh, cold boosts your immune system. And yeah, that's true under certain conditions. It can also deplete your immune system and limit your ability to fight off infections under other conditions. And perhaps the last thing to say about this is that I am a big believer in using nasal breathing whenever you don't have to breathe through your mouth. So if you're exercising hard, by all means breathe through your mouth. If you're doing martial arts, and it requires that you breathe through your mouth, go ahead and do that. But if you're doing, say a zone two cardio, low level cardio, or you're just walking along, it's very clear based on a growing amount of data that being a nasal breather is better than being a mouth breather. And there are a number of different reasons for that we've talked about on the podcast and elsewhere. But one of the additional reasons is a main site of entry for infections is through the mouth. So keep that mouth shut unless you need to talk. Thank you for joining for the beginning of this",

To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these ask me anything sessions, plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the Huberman Lab podcast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. Just to remind you why we launched the Huberman Lab podcast premium channel it's really twofold. First of all, it's to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which of course, will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length. We are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast and to fund research, in particular, research done on human beings, so not animal models but on human beings, which I think we all agree is the species that we are most interested in. And we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance. And those protocols will be distributed through all channels, not just the premium channel, but through all channels, Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. So the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the Tiny Foundation has generously offered to do dollar for dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel. So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science related tools, for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to sign up for the Huberman Lab premium channel, again, there's a cost of $10 per month, or you can pay $100 up front for the entire year. That will give you access to all the AMAs you can ask questions and get answers to your questions. And you'll of course get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well. There will also be some premium content such as transcripts of the AMAs and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman Lab podcast episodes and not found elsewhere. And again, you'll be supporting research for mental health, physical health, and performance. You can sign up for the premium channel by going to hubermanlab.com/premium. Again, that's hubermanlab.com/premium. And as always, thank you for your interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]",

                "transcript": "So without further ado, let's get to answering your questions. The first question is about the pros and cons of daily caffeine consumption. The question reads, what is your opinion on the net benefit of daily caffeine consumption? And how can somebody determine if daily caffeine consumption is right for them? Well, first of all, I did an entire episode about caffeine. You can find that by going to hubermanlab.com. At that website, you can put in caffeine into the search function, and you'll find links to that episode in all the formats-- YouTube, Apple, Spotify, et cetera. And it's timestamped, of course. You can navigate to the particular topics most of interest to you. However, for sake of this discussion, I can summarize a few of the key points. The most important thing to understand is that for most adults-- so that is people about age 18 to 20 and older-- daily caffeine consumption is not going to be a problem provided it does not induce anxiety, and certainly provided that it not induce anxiety or panic attacks, and provided that it does not disrupt your nighttime sleep. This is why I always recommend that if you are going to consume caffeine in any form, coffee, tea, soda, or otherwise, that you try not to ingest caffeine within the eight and ideally within the 10 or even 12 hours prior to bedtime. That's because the half life of caffeine is such that even if you are able to, for instance, have a cup of coffee around 3:00 PM or 4:00 PM and then fall asleep around midnight, the architecture of the sleep that you get is going to be disrupted. For instance, it is very important that you get sufficient amounts of both slow wave deep sleep as well as rapid eye movement sleep each night. And if you consume caffeine too close to bedtime-- and here, I'm defining to close as anywhere from 8 to 12 hours before going to sleep-- chances are you're not going to get as much rapid eye movement sleep or slow wave sleep that you would otherwise. And it is the amount of rapid eye movement sleep and slow wave sleep that, together, lead to whether or not you feel you had a good night's sleep in terms of your next day alertness and cognitive abilities. Now, again, some people may find that they can drink caffeine in the late afternoon, maybe even at night, and still fall asleep. But I promise you, even if you're in that category, you will sleep far better, meaning the architecture of your sleep will be better, and you will feel far more rested the next day if you abstain from caffeine within the eight to 12 hours prior to bedtime. And I should also say that none of us are perfect,",

                "desc": "Further insights into caffeine consumption, its impact on mental and physical health, and how it works in the body.",
                "transcript": "And I should also say that none of us are perfect, myself included. I will sometimes have a cup of coffee in the late afternoon, and sometimes that will cause me to stay up a little bit later. Sometimes it won't. I don't think you want to obsess or worry too much about having some caffeine every once in a while in the late afternoon if you are still able to fall asleep, but don't make it a regular habit. Now, as far as we know, there is no drawback to consuming caffeine on a daily basis, again, provided it does not disrupt your nighttime sleep and provided that does not induce anxiety. In fact, most of the world consumes caffeine every single day. The current estimates are that 90%-- that's right, 9-0, 90%-- of adults throughout the world consume a caffeinated beverage every single day. That's a staggeringly high number, making caffeine the most popular drug on the planet. In fact, because of the way that caffeine works-- and just to remind you how it works-- it effectively blocks adenosine receptors. Adenosine is a molecule that builds up in your brain and body more and more according to how long you've been awake. It makes you feel sleepy. Caffeine blocks the adenosine receptor, and then when it is dislodged from that receptor, whatever adenosine has built up and is around can then bind to the adenosine receptor. It makes you feel very sleepy. That's the caffeine crash. So if 90% of the adult population of the planet Earth is consuming caffeine every day, that means 90% of the adult population of planet Earth is blocking their adenosine receptors for some portion of their daily life, and then their adenosine is binding to the vacant receptor once the caffeine has dislodged. And why are 90% of adult humans consuming caffeine every day? Well, to feel more energized, more focused, to have more both cognitive energy and physical energy. Now, of course, most people are not walking around thinking, oh, caffeine gives me more energy more focus, et cetera. Most people are consuming caffeine every single day and are consuming caffeine every single day in order to feel, quote, unquote, normal, to be at their baseline level of cognitive ability, and physical energy, and so on. In fact, if you look at the data on caffeine consumption, what you'll find is that caffeine actually is a cognitive enhancer. It can improve learning and memory. It can increase physical energy. It can increase mental and physical stamina. But a feature of those studies that's not often discussed but that was, however, discussed in the full episode on caffeine is that studies of caffeine typically are done by taking chronic caffeine users and then having them abstain from caffeine for some period of time, usually four days to two weeks, in which time they undergo caffeine withdrawal. They do not feel well. They get foggy headed. They have less energy. There's some malaise, sometimes even some mild depression. And then what they do is they have people take caffeine, and take a cognitive exam, or do some physical activity and compare their performance to what it was when they were in the withdrawal state. Another typical form of study on caffeine is to take people who are naive to caffeine or who never take caffeine, and then have them ingest caffeine, and then measure their cognitive and/or physical performance. And in both cases, you see improvements. What I'm saying here is that daily caffeine consumption is not going to lead to improvements in cognitive ability or improvements in physical ability above one's baseline unless you either abstain from caffeine for some period of time, typically four days to two weeks prior, or you are not somebody who typically ingests caffeine. In other words, 90% of the world's population is drinking caffeine on a daily basis to be at their normal level of mental and physical functioning. So the question was, is there a net benefit to daily caffeine consumption? And here I can reliably say, provided you don't suffer from anxiety attacks or lack of sleep from the caffeine consumption, provided that you're mindful of not ingesting caffeine too late in the day, there doesn't seem to be any big drawback to drinking caffeine on a daily basis. However, there doesn't seem to be any great benefit, at least in terms of direct effects on cognitive or physical ability. So I realize this is a little bit of a convoluted answer, but we have to be honest with one another here. Caffeine is a performance-enhancing drug, but only when compared to the noncaffeinated state. And 90% of the adult population of the world is caffeinated. So adding more caffeine above what you would normally consume is certainly not going to allow you to think better and perform better physically. Here's a useful way to think about caffeine. Most people can pretty well tolerate doses of caffeine, anywhere from 100 milligrams to 300 milligrams. It depends on body weight and depends on your tolerance, tolerance, of course, based on how familiar you are with the effects of caffeine and how regularly you consume it. A typical cup of coffee, which, by the way, does not exist. Depending on the vendor, depending on how much water-to-coffee ratio one uses, depending on whether or not it's French press or it's pour over, the type of coffee, et cetera, all of that is going to determine the total amount of caffeine in that coffee. But we can set some outer bounds on the total amount of caffeine that likely exists in a cup of coffee, and it's probably somewhere between 100 milligrams-- that would be on the weaker side for a six or eight ounce cup of coffee-- out to about 300 milligrams for the equivalent six to eight ounces of coffee. But if you were to brew your coffee very, very strong or, like me, occasionally throw a shot of espresso in there, too, you could get that number up to 400 or 500 milligrams of caffeine. I personally tolerate caffeine pretty well. I've been drinking caffeine since I was a teenager, mostly in the form of brewed unflavored yerba mate tea. It's important to stay away from the smoked varieties of yerba mate if you're going to get your caffeine from your yerba mate. The smoked varieties can be carcinogenic. The nonsmoked varieties don't seem to have that property. But there's a lot of caffeine in yerba mate, so I'll drink yerba mate and have for many, many years. Or I'll drink black coffee, or espresso, or espresso americano, things of that sort. That's my preferred source of caffeine. Most people are drinking coffee to get their caffeine",

                "transcript": "Most people are drinking coffee to get their caffeine and, I would say that, if you are going to drink your caffeine, drink it in the early part of the day, as I mentioned earlier. I am a big proponent of delaying your first caffeine intake until at least 90 minutes after waking in order to avoid the afternoon crash. I've talked a lot about this on the podcast. There are a lot of clips on the internet explaining the rationale behind that. And if you do experience an afternoon crash in energy, I do recommend delaying your morning caffeine intake to 90 to 120 minutes after waking. Now, for people that want to get more of a true cognitive-enhancing and performance-enhancing effect from caffeine, again, you're going to have to abstain from caffeine for about four days. For regular caffeine drinkers, that's going to be difficult. That is going to lead to headaches. That's going to lead to brain fog. That's going to lead to feelings of malaise. In fact, the last time I took four days off or even a week off from caffeine consumption was when I was sick. I don't get sick very often, but when I am sick, I generally abstain from caffeine. And sometimes I wonder whether or not the malaise I feel from whatever viral or bacterial thing I might be dealing with when I'm sick is, in part, the malaise of caffeine withdrawal. I certainly notice I feel much better when I return to drinking caffeine, but that tends to coincide with feeling relief from whatever sinus symptoms and other symptoms I might have been experiencing from the illness. So it's not a good experiment. I can't tease apart those variables. So the short answer is, for most adults, there does not seem to be any major downside to consuming caffeine. And there have been scattered reports here and there in humans, showing that ingesting caffeine can increase dopamine receptors, which will effectively allow you to get more out of the dopamine that you produce. This is why caffeine has a mood elevating as well as energy-elevating effect. I should point out that some people just cannot tolerate caffeine. It makes them too jittery, too anxious. They start sweating. They get heart palpitations. It's very hard for these people to build up a tolerance to caffeine that allows them to enjoy it. These are the people that can even feel a fluttering of the heart and a lot of energy left from decaf coffee, something that, to me, is just a foreign. Concept but some people are just that sensitive to caffeine that even the small amounts of caffeine in chocolate or decaf coffee make them feel too alert. And they should abstain from caffeine. I don't think they are, in any way, harming their health by abstaining from caffeine. Then there's the issue of children, and adolescents, and teenagers, and young adults ingesting caffeine. And I covered some of this in the episode about caffeine, but there's been a lot of debate as to whether or not caffeine can cause osteoporosis, whether or not it can leach calcium out of the bones, whether or not can stunt growth. Frankly, there's not a lot of evidence for those sorts of claims, and yet the developing brain is a very tender and malleable environment. And somebody who started off his career as a developmental neurobiologist, studying developmental brain plasticity and wiring, it does sort of make me cringe to think about children younger than the age of, say, 14 ingesting large amounts of caffeine in any form-- soda, coffee, tea, et cetera. Despite the fact that there's very little evidence that it can stunt their growth, I don't personally like the idea of the young brain being bathed in an adenosine receptor antagonist, which is effectively what caffeine is. As much as possible, one wants the developing brain to develop in a milieu of unencumbered, nonchemically encumbered interactions between neurotransmitters and their receptors, unless, of course, there's a clinical need for a prescription drug, or a supplement, or some modification of a nutritional program specifically to up or down regulate the dopamine system or up or down regulate the serotonin system. But those are the sorts of decisions that really should be made in close oversight and recommendations by a psychiatrist. So the short answer around daily caffeine consumption in young people, meaning 14 and younger, is avoid it if you can. Have your children avoid caffeine if they can.",

                "transcript": "Have your children avoid caffeine if they can. The occasional bit of caffeine is probably not going to be a problem. The amount of caffeine in small amounts of chocolate, probably not going to be a problem. But caffeine in the form of energy drinks, sodas, coffee, tea for children younger than 14 just seems like a bad idea from everything we understand about brain wiring and the trajectories of brains that develop with a lot of chemical adjustment from other sources, like caffeine. Now, for kids age 15 to, say, 18 or 20, a lot of brain wiring is still occurring, but a lot of it has been completed. So probably not as risky to consume caffeine every once in a while or maybe even on a daily basis. But there are two-- I think there are great advantages to limiting the amount of caffeine that one ingests. And of course, in the adolescent and teen years, nowadays a lot of kids are consuming energy drinks and soda. And some of those energy drinks and so does contain a lot of caffeine, anywhere from 200 to 800 milligrams of caffeine. And nowadays, more sodas and energy drinks contain other things like amino acid precursors to neuromodulators, like dopamine. So for instance, a lot of energy drinks now contain L-tyrosine, which is a precursor to dopamine. A lot of them will contain L-theanine. I've talked about L-theanine as a supplement that can promote more restful sleep if taken 30 to 60 minutes before sleep. The reason why a lot of energy drinks, and sodas, and, frankly, now coffee brands are including theanine in the coffee, or energy drink, or soda is because it tends to have a mild anxiety-reducing effect. And it reduces the jitters that caffeine creates. And so that's actually a trick that these companies are using in order to get people to ingest more caffeine because, by including the theanine, it's preventing the kid or adult from feeling too jittery. And therefore, they can continue to consume that drink without feeling like they're overstimulated. So if I were to take the parental neuroscientist adult voice here, I would say avoid caffeine intake as much as you can until you're about 18 years old. But I'm realistic. I realize that adolescents and teens age, say, 14, or 15, out to 18, and older are going to be consuming caffeine in the form of energy drinks and sodas. But reducing the total amount of caffeine that one is ingesting in those years, it just seems really advantageous, again, m all the same reasons I mentioned earlier. You don't want the young brain bathing in a bunch of exogenous, meaning externally introduced neurochemicals or in things like theanine or L-tyrosine. If you're going to indulge in caffeine, or in energy drinks, or theanine, or L-tyrosine, for that matter, that's the sort of thing that probably is best left for people 18 and older. And even there, if one finds that caffeine is for them, as do I, I think always best to try and get your caffeine from a clean source, a clean source meaning something that contains just coffee or just tea. Again, this isn't a knock on energy drink specifically, but you really have to make sure that whatever energy drink you're going to consume, you know what's in it. You recognize what the different ingredients do. And you recognize the potential of ingesting those ingredients chronically over and over again. And I've talked to a little bit about this on previous podcasts, and I'll get into this. Again, maybe we'll do an entire episode about energy drinks because they are so commonly consumed nowadays. Now, getting back to the original question about daily caffeine consumption, this person goes on to say that, for them-- OK, this is their personal experience-- after a few weeks of consumption of daily caffeine, the negatives start to outweigh the positive ones. They're getting poor-quality sleep, lack of appetite, anxiety, et cetera. And when they don't consume caffeine, they find it a lot easier to be mindful, and their meditation practice is much better. But they're lethargic and less motivated. So what they're describing are all the classic symptoms of caffeine overuse, probably not abuse in this case, although caffeine can be truly abused, people taking caffeine pills, et cetera in large quantities. We're not talking about that. But this person is describing the classic pattern of overuse of caffeine and the classic pattern of withdrawal from caffeine when they stop taking it. So what should somebody like this do? And I think that's an important question",

                "transcript": "And I think that's an important question to answer because I think a lot of people fall into this category. They drink caffeine every day. They're no longer getting the performance-enhancing effect of caffeine, so they're taking it just to be normal or feel like they can focus normally and have normal amounts of energy. But then if they try and come off, they feel worse. There are a couple of ways to do this. You can taper your caffeine intake off over the course of four to seven days. But most people don't have the discipline or don't want to spend the time doing that. But if you want to, the way you would do that is you would cut it by about 10% or 15% per day. You could do that by volume, or you could do that by concentration of coffee, that sort of thing. A simpler way to go about all this that still will allow you to get some of the performance-enhancing effects of caffeine and yet experience far less withdrawal would be two things. First of all, just halve your amount of caffeine intake for two or three days. So again, that could be by volume, or it could be by concentration, probably easiest to do by volume. And so instead of drinking an eight ounce coffee in the morning, maybe you do four ounces of regular coffee, four ounces of decaf, or you just have the four ounces of coffee. You do that for three or four days, and then you take perhaps one full day off from caffeine, maybe another full day off. You're going to feel a lot less bad on those two days, having cut your caffeine intake in half in the previous four days then you would if you just went cold turkey. And then you go back to ingesting caffeine, but you go back to ingesting caffeine at that 50% dose or what used to represent that 50% dose of caffeine for you. And you just continue that way on a daily basis, and then every once in a while, when you want the performance-enhancing effects of caffeine, you go back to what was your original dose, which is now double what you're taking on a daily basis. So what we're really talking about here is not going cold turkey. We're not talking about quitting caffeine indefinitely. What we're talking about is cutting the amount of caffeine that you drink in half for about four days, plus or minus a day, and then taking two days off from caffeine completely. And then going back on that half dose of caffeine indefinitely. That's your new baseline of caffeine intake. And then every once in a while, if you need a bit more of a lift, you ingest twice as much caffeine or a coffee that's twice as concentrated. We should acknowledge that most people aren't going to be really precise about the amount of ounces and the amount of caffeine. Nonetheless, it's pretty straightforward to know that you're reducing your caffeine intake. Certainly, it's clear to know if you're ingesting no caffeine for a couple of days. And it's pretty clear when you're doubling the amount of caffeine. But you don't have to worry so much that you're exactly doubling the amount of caffeine. You can drink one and a half times as much as you happen to drink on the day before, or you could drink three times as much. You would definitely feel it if you drink three times as much. One very important thing to recognize is that, on any day where you really spike your caffeine intake above baseline, no matter where that baseline is when you start-- it could be 0. It could be 400 milligrams. It could be 200 milligrams. When you double that intake, you will get a big boost of energy, and the next day, you're going to feel the crash from that. You're going to feel more lethargic. You're going to feel not so good. This has to do with dopamine receptor modulation. This has to do with adenosine receptor modulation. The important thing to do is not continue to consume that elevated level of caffeine, which is what most people do, and then they set a new hire baseline just to feel normal. The key thing is to just manage to get through that crash day, manage to get through that one day where you feel a little less good or maybe even down a bit. Get outside a bit. Get some more sunshine. We know that spikes your cortisol in a good way. It can increase the catecholamines, dopamine, et cetera. Get a little bit more sunlight. Get a little bit more movement. Get outside. Do something to offset those feelings of malaise, and then get right back to your original goal level of caffeine each day. There's no use in getting so quantitative that you make your life miserable, you're measuring things out like a laboratory chemist. If you're that type and you want to do that, be my guest. But unless you're taking caffeine in pill form, it's very, very hard to get extremely exact about the amounts of caffeine that you're ingesting. So it is OK to eyeball it, but understand the contour of how caffeine works and what the caffeine performance-enhancing effect comes from. It comes from a caffeine intake above baseline. Understand that any time you go above baseline with your caffeine intake, there's the potential of some anxiety. Understand that there's going to be a slight withdrawal effect that lasts about 24 to 48 hours. Battle through that short period, and you'll be right back where you started and where you need to be so that you can enjoy caffeine on a daily basis and derive the benefits because there are many benefits to drinking caffeine and avoiding some of the potential hazards. And again, if you're a young person, I recommend delaying that caffeine intake maybe, I don't know, 10 years. Thank you for joining for the beginning of this Ask Me Anything episode. To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these Ask Me Anything sessions plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the Huberman Lab podcast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. Just to remind you why we launched the Huberman Lab podcast premium channel, it's really twofold. First of all, it's to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which, of course, will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length-- we are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast-- and to fund research, in particular research done on human beings, so not animal models but on human beings, which I think we all agree is a species that we are most interested in. And we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance, and those protocols will be distributed through all channels, not just the premium channel but through all channels, Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. So the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the Tiny Foundation has generously offered to do dollar-for-dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel. So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science-related tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to sign up for the Huberman Lab Premium channel, again, there's a cost of $10 per month, or you can pay $100 up front for the entire year. That will give you access to all the AMAs. You can ask questions and get answers to your questions, and you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well. There will also be some premium content, such as transcripts of the AMAs and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman Lab podcast episodes not found elsewhere. And again, you'll be supporting research for mental health, physical health, and performance. You can sign up for the premium channel by going to hubermanlab.com/premium. Again, that's hubermanlab.com/premium. And as always, thank you for your interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]",

                "transcript": "The first question is about kratom. And the question is, what are the short and long-term effects of taking kratom? For those of you that haven't heard of kratom, kratom is a substance that comes from a tree that grows naturally in Indonesia. The tree itself is called mitragyna speciosa. And it's been known for hundreds of years or more. We don't really know how long, but at least for a couple of hundred years, that when people chew the leaves of this tree, they experience a mild stimulant effect. And there's also a process of extraction whereby you can take the leaves and get high concentrations of kratom that nowadays is packaged into various supplements. Most often consumed in capsule form, although sometimes it's sold in raw powder form. Here's the key thing to understand about kratom. Indeed at low dosages, kratom has a mild stimulant effect. However, at higher dosages, it has what's called an analgesic effect, that is a painkilling effect, and it acts as a sedative. And kratom itself acts as an opioid in the body. This is what's making kratom a very controversial topic these days. In particular, because most people have heard of the so-called opioid crisis. The opioid crisis has been a term coined to largely center around issues that have taken place in the United States, although these issues definitely extend beyond the borders of the United States. But the opioid crisis is essentially the overconsumption and widespread addiction to opioids. Opioids include things like morphine, oxycodone, also called OxyContin, and there are other opioids similar to those compounds, all of which have the general effect of being painkillers and sedatives. And in some people, again some people, eliciting a sense of euphoria in particular at low to moderate dosages. However, people quickly develop a tolerance to those drugs and need to consume more and more of them in order to get the effect that they initially got from a lower dosage. And they are not just highly habit-forming. They are highly addictive. And we can distinguish between habit forming and addictive by simply saying that addictive means people will continue to take something or do something despite negative consequences. There are other relevant definitions of addiction as well. I define addiction more broadly as the progressive narrowing",

                "transcript": "I define addiction more broadly as the progressive narrowing of the things that give you pleasure. And indeed, when people get addicted to opioids, it is a very bad picture. It often hampers many, many areas of their lives, and seriously so. So the opioid crisis refers to the overprescription of opioid drugs. That's sort of what it generally taken to mean. But it also includes accessing opioids such as morphine, oxycodone, et cetera through gray market sources through, black market sources, and on and on. And of course, the acquisition of the drugs is just one piece it's also the over consumption of those drugs and, of course, the addiction to those drugs, which has proved to be so pernicious. So what does this have to do with kratom? Kratom is also an opioid. And we'll talk about how it differs in its opioid properties from the drugs I just talked about because it is different from morphine and hydrocodone, but it also has some similar properties as well. But the deal with kratom is that a good number of people out there have managed to wean themselves off opioids such as morphine and hydrocodone through the use of kratom. And that has been used as justification for keeping kratom on the market and keeping it legal. However, and this is a very important however, kratom itself has also proved to be not only habit forming but addictive, especially when taken at dosages that exceed that lower dose that just generally creates a bit of stimulant, a little bit of euphoric effect. When people start taking higher dosages of kratom, it is very clear that it does become addictive, and itself is very hard to come off of, so much so that people experience so-called kratom withdrawal. Now the reason I mentioned that kratom",

                "transcript": "Now the reason I mentioned that kratom has been used by a good number of people to wean themselves off of the more potent forms of prescription opioids is that when I solicited for questions about kratom on social media, it was a very binary response. In fact, there was one camp a very rabid camp that said kratom is terrible. I took this stuff. I got addicted. It was extremely hard to come off of. There were additional comments in there, such as I know somebody who literally had to go to rehab because of kratom who developed a bunch of other addictions because of kratom. Essentially many, many responses of people who had only bad experiences with kratom. Meaning they liked it enough at first that they continued to take it, and it became addictive for them or somebody that they know. However, there was another camp that was equally vocal, which kept saying no if one really adheres to the lower dosages of kratom, kratom itself can be a useful tool for getting off other opioids. And there were even a few bona fide medical professionals, medical doctors that is, and I happen to know them and their reputations as quite good, who chimed in and sort of reconciled the two camps by saying indeed, if one can avoid taking kratom at all, you should. There is no reason to take this thing thinking that it's quote-unquote good for you. You would be wise to avoid taking it because there is a high probability if you take it at a given dosage or at a dosage that is going to get your brain and body into a state of euphoria, analgesia, and the sort of classic opioid effect that it's going to become habit forming or addicting for you. That said, these same medical professionals acknowledged that a fair number of people that they knew managed to get off of the more potent forms of opioids such as morphine, oxycodone, and so forth using kratom. And they said, well if it's a choice between being addicted to morphine and hydrocodone versus taking kratom and addicted to those substances and kratom somehow allowed them to taper off of those substances, that they would look more favorably upon kratom if and only if they would also commit to progressively lowering their dose of kratom and eventually coming off of kratom. So the general takeaway from all of that is if you can avoid taking kratom, meaning if you haven't taken it already, don't. And that reminds me of a very important point, which",

                "transcript": "And that reminds me of a very important point, which a guest on the Huberman lab podcast Dr. Robert Malenka who's an M.D. and Ph.D. He's my colleague at Stanford School of Medicine. He's a world expert on the mechanisms underlying addiction and dopamine and drug reinforcement, among many other things. What he said on the podcast is absolutely true, which is that it is impossible to get addicted to a substance that you've never consumed. That might seem obvious but think about that one again. It is impossible to get addicted to a substance that you've never consumed. So I think the safest statement to make is if you have not tried kratom, you would be wise to avoid it because you stand a chance to become addicted to it. If, however, you are somebody that's addicted to other forms of opioids, you absolutely should talk to your physician about that and how to get off of those opioids. But there is evidence that some people have used kratom to successfully wean themselves off the more potent forms of opioids that I talked about, namely morphine and hydrocodone, as well as a few others. Now if you're somebody who already takes kratom, you need to be very thoughtful about the dosage that you take. And you also need to be thoughtful about the fact that people differ dramatically in their response to opioids. This is oh so important, and people do not talk about this enough. We hear, for instance, that, oh, if people are taking anywhere from one to five grams, maybe one to six grams of kratom per day, that's keeping it in the dosage range for which people don't generally tend to get addicted, you'll hear things like that. And by the way, when I say one to five or one to six grams per day, I'm not talking about the individual compounds that are present in kratom. There are a couple of different plant alkaloids I'll talk about in a moment that are present in kratom. And these have different effects on the opioid system. So nowadays, some of the companies that sell kratom. And by the way, this is sold over the counter as a supplement. It does not require a prescription to purchase, at least at this point in time, in the United States. Some of these products will have a higher concentration of one or the other alkaloids within them such that you can't really compare one gram of one brand of kratom to one gram of another brand of kratom because they can have wildly different levels of these different alkaloids. And these different alkaloids have wildly different impact on different aspects of your brain and body biology. In particular, how much they tend to impact the so-called endogenous opioid system, OK.",

                "transcript": "the so-called endogenous opioid system, OK. So when we talk about dosages, we have to keep this in the back of our mind. And we have to keep in the back of our mind that there does seem to be a subgroup of people. We don't know how big this subgroup of people is, but we know it's not everyone, but it's somewhere between 10 and 40% of people seem to respond to opioids in a particularly potent way. They really like them. And perhaps not surprisingly, people outside of that category don't tend to like opioids. I can certainly say that I am somebody who, when I've been prescribed things like Vicodin or any other opioid post-surgery for pain, I hate taking those drugs. I absolutely hate it. I'd rather deal with the pain. They make me nauseous. They make me feel terrible. That said, I know people who love opioids. It's like a natural fit for their chemistry in the sense that it tends to evoke more euphoria. They just immediately like the feeling. Some of you may remember the episode of the Huberman Lab podcast that I did about alcohol. And there, too, I discussed the fact that about 8% to 10% of people who consume alcohol get an increased dopamine response to alcohol that's not observed in other people. And that particular subgroup of people is very, very at risk for developing alcohol use disorder, sometimes called alcoholism, because they can drink in a way and they experience a high from drinking in a way that other people simply do not experience. Now like everybody else, if they consume too much alcohol, they get drunk. So it's not about the drunk effect, it's about the dopamine and other sorts of chemicals that are released in those people in response to alcohol that other people just don't seem to experience at the same level of potency. So again, with things like kratom and the other opioids, there's a category of people, and it's a much larger category of people, again 10% to 40%. We don't know exactly how many because the studies are not really completed, and there aren't enough of those studies yet, unfortunately. But when those people take an opioid, wow, oh, wow, do they like it. And those people, in particular, are very much at risk for developing an addiction to opioids. And so those people, especially, should never ever go near kratom if they haven't. Or if they are already taking kratom, these are the people that are constantly ratcheting up their dose. These are the people that tell you no, I'm not addicted, but if you were to say, hey, all right, well then let's do an experiment where you don't take kratom for a week, those are going to be the people that are suddenly going to get anxious about the mere idea of that. I've also talked about this in reference to cannabis when I did an episode about cannabis. Again I'm not putting a blanket statement out there about cannabis as being good or bad. On that episode, I talked about the fact that cannabis does indeed have various therapeutic uses. But that there are a good number of people who rely on cannabis for anxiety control and other ways of modulating their brain chemistry and bodily chemistry such that if you were to say, hey, are you addicted to cannabis? They'd say no, I don't have to smoke cannabis. I don't have to take my edibles. But if you were to push them a little bit and say, all right, well then, let's do an experiment where you don't consume any cannabis in any form for 10 days. They don't like the idea of that experiment at all. So much so that were they to run that experiment, they would experience a lot of the withdrawal symptoms associated with addiction. So I can't, in good faith, say that kratom is safe for everybody because it is simply not. Now is it safer than the other opioids? And if so, why? Well, in order to address that, let's take a short glance at the pharmacology of kratom and how it works in terms of its neurochemistry in the body. Now I'm going to keep this pretty brief because, in the future, I'm going to do an extended episode all about opioids, and I will include kratom in that conversation. But just to back up a little bit and discuss what opioids are. Opioids are compounds that can activate the so-called endogenous opioid system. All of us have within our brain and body the capacity to release our own opioids. That's right. You have opioids within your body. They are released from neurons, and they bind to so-called opioid receptors. Perhaps some of you have heard of the so-called runner's high. The runner's high is a euphoric state. It's a fairly mild euphoric state in most cases. But it's a euphoric state induced by long-duration effort, a.k.a. the runner's high. The runner's high is just a phrase used to explain that when we engage in long-duration repetitive action effort, the body starts releasing these endogenous opioids they bind to receptors, and they trigger things like analgesia, relief from pain. They trigger mild euphoria. They tend to change our perception of the outside world, make things look more beautiful, shiny. They give things a little bit of a sheen. What I just described is a mild version",

                "transcript": "What I just described is a mild version of what people experience when they take something like morphine. When people take morphine, there's a more of a sedative effect, there's more of a euphoric effect, and there's more of a dreamlike effect. And again, it will depend on dosage. Kratom and morphine, and hydrocodone all have the property of acting like the endogenous opioids but at much higher potency. When you bring them into your system, they cross the blood-brain barrier. So they go into the brain, and they bind to a number of different opioid receptors. There's the mu-opioid receptor. By the way, these names all follow Greek alphabet letters. So the mu-opioid receptor, the kappa opioid receptor, there are a bunch of different ones. Kratom binds preferentially to the mu-opioid receptor and somewhat to the kappa opioid receptor. There's a big misconception out there. A lot of people, especially people who are proponents of kratom, will say no morphine and hydrocodone bind the mu-opioid receptor, whereas kratom binds the kappa opioid receptor. So it's a different compound. Very, very different. Not true. Not true. Kratom, morphine, and hydrocodone all bind to the mu-opioid receptor. And that's what's largely responsible for its opioid-like effects. Especially when you get the dosage up to a level where you start getting the mild sedation, the analgesia, the pain relief. And keep in mind a lot of people are taking kratom because they want pain relief. And when that mu-opioid receptor system is activated, it indirectly activates a lot of the reinforcement circuitry in the brain that relates to dopamine and serotonin. This is another area that we'll go into in more depth in the future. But there's been a lot of controversy. People saying, oh, you know kratom doesn't trigger the dopamine system, therefore, it's not addictive. But that is simply not true. It indirectly activates the reinforcement circuitry that includes both dopamine and serotonin. But its primary effect is to hit this mu-opioid receptor system that exists in a bunch of places in the brain but mainly in the brainstem in a structure called the periaqueductal gray nucleus, which then provides pain relief. It triggers a number of different shifts in cognition. It's what creates that mild euphoria, et cetera, et cetera. Now how can we be so confident that kratom is acting so similarly to hydrocodone and to morphine, albeit with lower potency? And the reason is if you give people a drug that blocks the mu-opioid receptor prior to them taking kratom, they don't experience any of the classic effects of taking kratom. No euphoria, no analgesia, no sedation. Even at the low dosages no mild stimulant effect. So we really have to look at kratom as an opioid, OK.",

                "transcript": "So we really have to look at kratom as an opioid, OK. That's just the honest truth. And if you're somebody who doesn't like this message because you like kratom, I'm not telling you that you don't like kratom, I'm telling you likely like kratom because it's an opioid. So again, if you go online and you start asking questions about kratom, again, you're going to see these two camps. You're going to see the kratom is terrible, it's addictive, it's everything bad camp. And then you're going to see the other camp out there very vocal as well, talking about how kratom helped them avoid other things that are worse. And this is an argument that, frankly, I don't think we want to lean on, right. The idea that substance A is not as bad as substance B. And that making substance A unavailable is just going to send everyone running for substance B. That's a weak argument, frankly. I heard this argument around cannabis. And by the way, I think pretty balanced about cannabis. If you listen to the episode I did on cannabis, I think you'll agree that I believe that cannabis has its therapeutic applications. I also believe that young people, especially young males with a predisposition to psychosis, should not be taking high-concentration THC cannabis. Because the data tell us they are already at risk of psychosis, and they are at a much greater risk of psychosis if they do. So I think I'm pretty balanced about the story on cannabis. But I often hear the argument oh cannabis isn't as bad as alcohol and, therefore, cannabis is good. That's simply not rational. What we should be saying is whether or not it's cannabis or alcohol or kratom or any substance for that matter, what are the potential benefits, what are the potential risks? And again, this is far too much than we can go into in this AMA. And we will go into in a future full-length episode of the Huberman Lab podcast. But the other thing to really keep in mind is the lack of regulation over kratom supplements. Now as many of you know, I am a fan of many, not all, but many supplements in certain conditions. I always say behavior is first, then nutrition. Then if and only if it's needed, rely on supplementation. But supplementation is a big category. But when we're talking about supplements that are opioid compounds, I start to get nervous because of the high abuse potential and the high addiction potential of opioids. And kratom is included in that category. A couple of other key notes about kratom. While death directly from kratom is fairly rare, it has happened. Now hydrocodone and morphine suppress respiration. Actually, suppress breathing by way of a mechanism that, if you're a listener of the Huberman Lab podcast, you know about. Which is the so-called physiological sigh. Many of you have heard me talk about the physiological sigh. Is something that you do voluntarily the double Inhale through the nose and then a long exhale in order to rapidly reduce your level of stress. As far as we know, that's the fastest way to deliberately lower your level of stress. But the physiological sigh was discovered in the 1930s",

When I interviewed Dr. Jack Feldman, who is a professor at University of California Los Angeles and really the pioneer of the modern neuroscience understanding of respiration, he talked about some studies in his laboratory that were exploring why people die when taking opioids. This is a major issue associated with the opioid crisis. And what he mentioned was that the opioids bind to particular receptors in the brain stem locations that generate physiological sighs. So opioids, when taken as drugs, suppress physiological sighing and do so during sleep. And lack of adequate respiration, meaning people stop breathing during sleep, is one of the primary reasons why people die when they take opioids. Now kratom is not known to suppress respiration when taken at low to moderate dosages. But when combined with any other opioids, and certainly when combined with alcohol, it can suppress respiration. And while the data on this are fairly scant, there is some evidence that kratom-induced death is caused by suppression of the respiration system. So again, death due to taking kratom at the dosages that are recommended on most commercial packaging is fairly rare, although it has happened. It's unclear if it happened because it was taken in combination with other compounds. That seems likely. But we can't forget that a lot of people are taking kratom at much higher dosages and, in fact, progressively higher and higher dosages from these over-the-counter sources. And with increased dosage, there is, yes, an increased risk of respiratory failure. So again, all of this points to the fact that kratom is simply not a benign substance. So if we're going to be very honest, the addictive potential of kratom is real. It is exacerbated for some people compared to others, but it is real. It's very similarities to other more potent forms of opioids are what make it attractive for some people who are trying to come off those more potent form of opioids. But the goal, of course, is to completely come off all opioids. And kratom itself can be a bit of a trap. It can be a trap in the sense that people who have never taken other opioids can become addicted to kratom itself. That is absolutely clear that can happen. It has happened in a great number of people.",

                "transcript": "It has happened in a great number of people. It's also clear that kratom can potentially be a trap. Notice I said potentially. Because if people are trying to come off other more potent forms of opioids and then they use kratom to do that, and then they're ratcheting up their dosage of kratom such that they're now matching the endogenous response to kratom in a way that doesn't really distinguish from the effects that they were getting from morphine and hydrocodone, well then they're just using a different form of morphine and hydrocodone. And I'm sure that some of you are out there saying that is ridiculous. You cannot compare the effects of kratom to the effects of hydrocodone. But the potency is about one-sixth of hydrocodone. And there are people out there who are just increasing and increasing both the dosage and modifying the type of kratom that they're taking so that they're getting the kratom that has a particularly high concentration of one of the alkaloids that hits that mu-opioid receptor hardest. And in doing so, sure, they're not getting the pure hydrocodone effect, but they're getting really close. So my advice would be, if you haven't touched kratom, don't touch it at all, ever. If you are taking kratom, you need to take note of what we just discussed. Thank you for joining for the beginning of this Ask Me Anything episode. To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these, Ask Me Anything sessions plus, to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the Huberman lab podcast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. Just to remind you why we launched the Huberman lab podcast premium channel, it's really twofold. First of all, it's to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which of course, will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length. We are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast. And to fund research. In particular, research done on human beings. So not animal models but on human beings, which I think we all agree is a species that we are most interested in. And we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance. And those protocols will be distributed through all channels, not just the premium channel but through all channels. Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. So the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth. And allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now an especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the Tiny Foundation has generously offered to do dollar-for-dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel. So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science-related tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to sign up for the Huberman Lab Premium channel, again, there's a cost of $10 per month, or you can pay $100 up front for the entire year. That will give you access to all the AMAs. You can ask questions and get answers to your questions. And you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well. There will also be some premium content, such as transcripts of the AMAs and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman Lab podcast episodes not found elsewhere. And, again, you'll be supporting research for mental health, physical health, and performance. You can sign up for the premium channel by going to hubermanlab.com/premium. Again that's hubermanlab.com/premium. And as always, thank you for your interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]",

This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however part of my desire and effort, to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Inside Tracker. Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I'm a big believer in blood tests and DNA tests for the simple reason that many of the factors that are important for your short-term and long-term health and overall wellbeing can only be analyzed from blood and DNA tests. Things like metabolic factors and hormone levels, really can only be assessed accurately from blood and DNA. The thing I like about Inside Tracker is you don't just get back levels of different hormones and metabolic factors and so forth, you also get directives. It has a dashboard that's very easy to use that tells you based on your data, what sorts of foods you might want to eat more of or less of. What forms of exercise you might want to do more of or less of. It's really a wonderful way to assess how your behaviors and lifestyle choices are interacting with what's going on deep within your biology. Inside Tracker makes all of that super easy to understand. It's also really easy to get the blood tests and DNA tests taken. You can go to a local location or they can send somebody to your home if you prefer that. If you'd like to try Inside Tracker you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman to get 25% off any of Inside Trackers plans. Use the code Huberman at checkout. That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 25% off any off any of Inside Tracker's plans and use the code Huberman at checkout. Today's episode is also brought to you by Helix Sleep. Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are designed to meet your sleep needs, in order to optimize your sleep. I've done several episodes of this podcast and there's a ton of information out there pointing to the fact that getting really deep restful sleep each night is vital for mental and physical health. And the mattress that you sleep on and the pillow that you use is very important for getting optimal sleep. Helix Sleep has a brief two minute quiz that you can take. It asks you questions like, \"Do you sleep on your side, or your back or your stomach or maybe you don't know? Do you tend to run hot or cold as you sleep or maybe you don't know?\" That two minute quiz matches you to a mattress and pillow that's ideal for your sleep needs. I took this quiz, I matched to the mattress they call \"The Dusk,\" D-U-S-K. And I've been sleeping on \"The Dusk\" mattress for many months now and I've been sleeping better than I ever have before. It's really wonderful to have a really good night's sleep on a consistent basis. It's a total game changer. So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress, you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman. Take their two minutes sleep quiz and they'll match you to a customized mattress. And you'll get up to $200 off any of their mattress orders and two free pillows. So that's helixsleep.com/huberman. Take the two minutes sleep quiz they'll match you to a mattress. And if you order one of their mattresses, you'll get up to $200 off any of their mattresses and two free pillows. They have a 10 year warranty and you get to try out the mattress for 100 nights risk-free and if you don't like it they'll pick it up and take it away. If you love it, then you keep it. And I think there's a very good chance that you're going to love it, I certainly loved mine. And today's episode is also brought to you by Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I started using Athletic Greens way back in 2012. And so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. I started using Athletic Greens because I found it rather confusing to figure out what vitamins and minerals to take. And in Athletic Greens, I get all the vitamins and minerals I need to cover my bases. As well probiotics are really important. Probiotics have been shown now in numerous studies to be important for the gut microbiome, which impacts the gut brain axis, as well as various aspects of bodily health. So in Athletic Greens I get vitamins, minerals and probiotics. I also really like the way it tastes. It's a greens drink, so you mix it with some water. You could mix it with something else like juice if you like. I mix mine with water and lemon juice and I drink it once or twice a day. If you want to try Athletic Greens you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman. And if you do that, you'll claim their special offer, which is to get a years supply of vitamin D3 K2. There's now also a wealth of data showing that Vitamin D3 is important for various aspects of brain and body health. So that's athleticgreens.com/huberman for Athletic Greens and a years supply of Vitamin D3 K2. You'll also get five free travel packets. The travel packets are just a really convenient way to take Athletic Greens when you're on the road, in the car or on a plane or just moving around. You just empty one of the packets into a water bottle or a glass and mix it up really quickly. It saves any kind of mess or anything of that sort. So once again athleticgreens.com/huberman to get Vitamin D3 K2. That's a year supply and the five free travel packs. It's a new month, which means it's a new topic here at the Huberman Lab Podcast. For the next four or so episodes, we're going to be talking all about hormone affects on the brain and body. So that's a huge number of different topics. We're going to talk about sex. We're going to talk about reproduction. We're going to talk about puberty a little bit more. We talked about that in a previous episode. We're going to talk about menopause. We're going to talk about birth control. We are going to talk about aggression, competition, winning, losing. Basically, we're going to cover as much about hormones as we possibly can in this month and in doing so we are going to go deep into tools and protocols. We are also going to talk about a lot of tools that relate to things that you might not want to do in order to optimize hormone health, regardless of stage of life or your goals et cetera. So it's sure to be a month rich with discussion, rich with tools and you're going to learn a lot of neuroscience and endocrinology. There's actually a field of neuro-endocrinology. It's actually where I started my graduate work. I did a masters in it. Which has only to say that I love the topic. I have a lot of friends that work on this topic, many of whom I've consulted for these episodes. And I'm really excited to share the information with you. Before we dive into today's episode, \"All About Emotions and Sex.\" I want to just to have a few announcements that are designed to point you to some useful resources.",

It's a really wonderful app. However, many of you quickly told me that the Mood Meter App isn't available in your area. You went to the link we posted and it just was saying not available in your area. The situation was actually a lot worse than that. The situation was that, when we recorded the episode the Mood Meter App was working. I know 'cause I downloaded a fresh copy of it to my phone. And then in the ensuing weekend, they took the Mood Meter App down for some repairs. The Mood Meter app is now up. It is available. I want to be really clear. It's not an app I'm affiliated with. I'm just mentioning it to you. They don't know me. I know them, but they don't know me. So we don't have any kind of business relationship. They do charge 99 cents for the app. I think the free version has disappeared in the last year or so. So that's Mood Meter app. We'll provide the link again and the link should be working. Hopefully they won't take it down again, in between this announcement and the release of this episode. Also just want to take a step back for a moment",

                "transcript": "Also just want to take a step back for a moment and talk a little bit about the logic of how to make the most of the information on the Huberman Lab Podcast. I tend to throw out a lot of information about a given topic. Many of you have pointed out however, that I don't cover certain things. And once again I'll just say the goal is always to be accurate, but there's no way I can be exhaustive. There's no way I can cover everything for a particular topic. The good news is we have time. My goal, at least in the first year of the Huberman Lab Podcast, is to give you a basis, a foundation in these different topics of neuro-plasticity, focus, sleep, hormones et cetera. And of course, to provide tools along the way. We are going to host guests, I've actually started recording with some of these guests already. And even those episodes will include a little what we call primer. A little description of the basics of a given topic so that you can get more information from those topics. My goal really is to educate you in these topics, give you a foundation in these topics and allow you to start exploring them here in the episodes with our future guests, but also in other podcasts and books and other sources of information. So for those of you that are saying, \"It's too much information.\" I just encourage you to remind yourself that you have a pause button you can return to it. Everything's timestamped. For those of you that feel, it's not enough information I'm not covering enough. Just know that this is just the beginning. We didn't intend to do this for a very long time and we will be thorough over time. So thanks for your patience and please be patient with yourselves. There's no reason why you have to digest all the information in one swoop. The other thing is that I've been told both that I speak too fast and speak too slow. So there's a wonderful solution to this. If I speak too fast or too slow you can adjust the speed in YouTube. If you're listening in a different format, I think you also can adjust the speed of playback. So that's something that wouldn't be possible in the classroom, but you may find useful. And then last but not least, I want to point people again to this NSDR,",

                "transcript": "I want to point people again to this NSDR, non-sleep deep rest protocol, that the folks over at Madefor have put out as a free resource. It does, as many of you pointed out, bear resemblance to things like yoga nidra and other forms of meditation. But what we've done is we've stripped out intentions or any kind of the verbiage related to what some people might perceive as kind of related to the yoga community or specific to kind of new age-y type techniques. Not because we don't like yoga nidra. In fact, I've done yoga nidra daily for almost the last goodness, eight years of my life. I love yoga nidra, but sometimes the complicated language can be a separator and can discourage people from taking on these protocols that are extremely useful. So NSDR is intentionally generic. It's designed to bring you into a state of deep relaxation through a combination of breathing and body scan. There's the you too script over at Madefor which is linked in the caption. And many people find that they prefer that to scripts like yoga nidra. Scripts where they're doing intentions and they're hearing a lot of kind of unusual language around the process. This is just very basic and I hope you'll enjoy it. And if you prefer the more typical yoga nidra scripts then go with those. There are many of them available on the internet and elsewhere. And last but not least I want to point out that, all our episodes now are subtitled both in English and in Spanish. So for those of you that prefer to digest this information in Spanish, that's now available to you in the subtitles. Today we're going to talk about The Science of Sex.",

                "transcript": "The Science of Sex. In particular, sexual differentiation. Now that's a complicated topic because sex is both a adjective, a noun and a verb, depending on the context. Today we're going to talk about the hormonal effects and the neural effects of particular events that happen during development and how those guide adolescent and adult behavior, including sexual preference. It's an area that's fascinating and for which, there are actually very solid textbook findings. So textbook findings means, that there are many studies that have been aggregated over decades. That point to what we now know to be absolute truths in terms of how hormones affect brain development, how the brain impacts hormonal development and how those interact to control behavior for instance. We are also going to talk about reproduction, the verb sex. And of course, sex the verb, can also be carried out independent of reproduction. It's not always, in particular in humans, just to produce offspring. So that's going to be covered in the next episode, but you absolutely need to understand the information in this episode, in order to make sense of the information in the next episode. So, today we're going to explore hormones. What they are, how they work, what leads to masculinization or feminization of the brain and body? I'll just throw out one really interesting fact that perhaps most of you didn't realize that hormones have direct effects on the body. Most people know that because there are hormone differences and sex differences in bodies in terms of genitalia and body hair, distribution of body hair et cetera. But there are also effects of hormones on the brain directly and believe it or not there're also effects on the spinal cord. On the neurons and structures within the spinal cord that impact in a very direct way, what sorts of behaviors are possible. So it's a fascinating area, you might notice I'm going to go a little bit more slowly through this topic than I normally do. I want to be extremely careful with my language. Some of these topics, some of you may be thinking are extremely sensitive, right? And of course, any discussion about sex and reproduction is a sensitive one. But today we're just talking about the biology. We're not getting into the cultural constraints or the cultural dialogue. What we're trying to do today is really get to the biology, the physiology, the endocrinology and the behavior. So let's start by talking about what hormones are just to remind you and what they do.",

Typically from something we call a gland, although they can also be released from neurons. But they're released often from glands, that travel and have effects both on that gland but also on other organs and tissues in the body. And that differentiates hormones from things like neurotransmitters, which tend to act more locally. So that's important. A hormone is a substance secreted at one location in the body, travels, and has impact on things elsewhere in the body. Examples of tissues that produce hormones would be the thyroid, the testes, the ovaries et cetera. And then of course there are areas of the brain like the hypothalamus and the pituitary, which are closely related to one another and release hormones that cause the release of yet other hormones out in the body. So we're going to cover all this. If you don't know anything about endocrinology, you're still going to be able to understand today's discussion. And we're going to start with a discussion about, what hormones actually do, to create this thing that we call masculinization or feminization. So let's start with development.",

                "transcript": "So let's start with development. Sperm meets egg. Everything that happens before that is a topic of the next episode. But, sperm meets egg. This is mammalian reproduction. And that egg starts to duplicate, it starts to make more of itself. It makes more cells. And eventually some of those cells become skin. Some of those cells become brain. Some of those cells become muscle. Some of those cells become fingers. All the stuff that makes up the brain and body plan. In addition, there are hormones that come both from the mother and from the developing baby, the developing fetus. That impact. whether or not the brain will be what they call organized masculine or organized feminine. And as I say this, I want you to try and discard with the cultural connotations or your psychological connotations, of what masculinization and feminization are. Because we're only centering on the biology. So typically, people have either two X chromosomes, and the traditional language around that is that person is female, right? Or an X chromosome and a Y chromosome and that person will become male. Now it's not always the case. There are cases where it's XXY, where there two X chromosomes plus a Y chromosome. There are also cases where it's XYY. Where they're two Y chromosomes. and these have important biological and psychological impacts. So the first thing we need to establish is that there is something called chromosomal sex. Whether or not they're two X chromosomes, or an X and Y chromosome, is what we call chromosomal sex. But the next stage of separating out the sexes, is what we call gonadal sex. Typically not always, but typically if somebody has testes for their gonads, we think of them as male. And if somebody has ovaries, we think of them as female. Although that's not always the case either. But let's just explore the transition from chromosomal sex to gonadal sex, because it's a fascinating one that we all went through in some form or another. So this XY that we typically think of as promoting masculinization of the fetus. We say that because on the Y chromosome there are genes and those genes have particular functions that suppress",

So on the Y chromosome there's a gene, which encodes for something called Mullerian Inhibiting Hormone. So there's actually a hormone that's programmed by the Y chromosome that inhibits the formation of Mullerian Ducts, which are an important part of the female reproductive apparatus. That's critical because, already we're seeing the transition between chromosome Y chromosome and gonad. And other genes on the Y chromosome promote the formation of testes. So there are genes like the SRY gene and other genes that promote the formation of testes, while they also inhibit the formation of the Mullerian Ducts. So the transition from chromosomal sex to gonadal sex is a very important distinction. It's kind of a fork in the road that happens very early in development while fetuses are still in the embryo. Now what's interesting as well, is that just because there's a Y chromosome that can suppress Mullerian Duct formation and there are other genes on the Y chromosome that promote testes development.",

The mother, which of course is carrying the fetus has an adrenal gland which can produce testosterone. There are instances for example, where a mother has either a tumor or for some other reason is secreting large levels of testosterone while carrying a fetus that is XX. And that leads to what we would call masculinization of certain aspects of the fetus. Typically, that will be enlarged clitoris. There also some examples of other phenotypes on the body that are created even though it's a purely XX chromosomal baby. So we have to distinguish between",

And so it actually is quite complicated. So you know, it's a long distance from chromosomes to gender identity and gender identity has a lot of social influences and roles. This is an area that right now is very dynamic and in the discussion out there as you know. But just getting from chromosomal sex to what we would call gonadal sex and hormonal sex and morphological sex, involves a number of steps. So today we're going to talk about those steps. And there's some fascinating things that do indeed relate to tools. Do indeed relate to some important behavioral choices. Important choices about things to avoid while pregnant. And for those of you that are not pregnant, things to avoid if you're thinking about eventually having children. And that is not to drive development in one direction or another, but there are examples where there are some deleterious things in our environment that can actually negatively impact what we call sexual development overall, regardless of chromosomal background. So let's get started with that. Let's talk a little bit more about what hormones do.",

                "transcript": "Let's talk a little bit more about what hormones do. Hormones generally have two categories of effects. They can either be very fast or they can be very slow. There are hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which act very fast. Adrenaline can increase your heart rate very fast when secreted into the body. Cortisol can be a little bit slower, but it also can have some very fast effects. And then there are hormones like. Like testosterone and estrogen, which we refer to as the sex steroid hormones. The sex steroid hormones can have quick effects through signaling. Meaning they can attach to cells and make those cells do different things. They can have a actually quite quick effects on the brain. A lot of people don't know this, but there are some very fast effects of estrogen and testosterone as well as long-term effects. These molecules, for those of you that are interested, are what it called lipophilic. Which just means that they like fatty stuff, they can actually pass through fatty membranes. And because the outside of cells, as well as the what's called the nuclear envelope. Where all the DNA contents and stuff are stuffed inside, are made of lipid, of fat. These steroid hormones can actually travel into cells and then get into the DNA. Basically interact with the DNA of cells in order to control gene expression. So they can change the sorts of things that cells will become and they can change the way that cells function in a long-term way. And that's actually how the presence of these genes like SRY and Mullerian inhibiting hormone, lead to reductions or elimination I should say, of things like the Mullerian Ducts and promote instead what's called in males the Wolffian Ducts. Or promote the development of testes rather than ovaries. So all you need to know is that hormones have short-term and long-term effects. And the long-term effects are actually related to their effects on genes and how those genes are expressed or repressed, in order to prevent them from having particular proteins made. So these hormones, these steroid hormones are exceedingly powerful. And if we're going to have a discussion about",

And de feminization, the suppression of certain pathways that are related to feminization of the body and brain. But there are some really fascinating twists in this story. So I've just thrown a lot of biology at you, but this is where it all starts to get incredibly surprising. You would think that it's straightforward, right?",

                "transcript": "You would think that it's straightforward, right? You have a Y chromosome you suppress the female reproductive pathway like the Mullerian Ducts. You promote the development of testes and then testes make testosterone. And then it organizes the brain male and it wants to do male like things. And then in females you get estrogen and it wants to do female like things. And air quotes here for all of this. It turns out that isn't how it works at all. Here's where it's interesting. We have to understand that there are effects of these hormones, testosterone and estrogen. on what are called primary sexual characteristics. Which are the ones that you're born with. Secondary sexual characteristics, which are the ones that show up in puberty. And these are happening in the brain and body and spinal cord. And so I'm going to disentangle all this for you by giving you some examples. First, let's talk about the development of primary sexual characteristics. The ones that show up at birth. And one of the more dramatic examples of this comes from the role of testosterone in creating the external genitalia. Now you might think it's just straight forward. If there's a testes, 'cause there's a Y chromosome. You know, you've got a gene that codes for the development of testes, you get testosterone and the penis grows and the baby is born with a penis. You know, one of the first things that happens when the baby comes out is they look at the genitalia, and they try and make an assessment on whether or not it's a quote boy or it's a quote girl, right? That's been done for a very very long time throughout human history. It turns out that it's not testosterone that's responsible for the development of the penis in a baby that has an X chromosome and a Y chromosome. It's a different androgen. Androgen is just a category of hormones that includes testosterone, but testosterone is converted in the fetus to something called dihydrotestosterone. And that's accomplished through an enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase. Now dihydrotestosterone has important effects later in life too. We will talk about those. In fact, if you just want to know, dihydrotestosterone is what we would call the dominant androgen in males. It's responsible for aggression. It's responsible for a lot of muscular strength. It's involved in beard growth and male pattern baldness. We're going to talk about all of that. But dihydrotestosterone has powerful effects in determining the genitalia, while the baby is still in the embryo. So this ends. There's testosterone that's made. And that testosterone gets converted by this enzyme 5-alpha-reductase in a little structure called the tubercle. That tubercle will eventually become the penis. So you say, \"Okay, straight forward.\" This testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone. And then if there's dihydrotestosterone it controls penis growth. And indeed that's the case. So that's a primary sexual characteristic. That baby will then grow up and later during puberty there will be the release of a molecule. I talked about this last episode called Kisspeptin. K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N kisspeptin, which will cause the release of some other hormones",

So dihydrotestosterone creates what we would call the typical masculine phenotype for primary sexual characteristics and produces. Testosterone excuse me, produces secondary sexual characteristics during puberty. There's a very interesting phenomenon that was published in The Journal of Science in the 1970s,",

                "transcript": "that was published in The Journal of Science in the 1970s, for which now there's a wealth of scientific data. And this relates to a genetic mutation, where 5-alpha-reductase the enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone doesn't exist. It's mutated in a way into a genome that it doesn't exist. And this actually was first identified in the Dominican Republic. It has shown up elsewhere. It's quite rare, but where it shows up it's robust. What happens is baby is born. Typically when a baby is born they don't measure chromosomes. They don't look at chromosomal sex XX or XY. That's not typically done nowadays. Baby is born. If you were to look at that baby, it would look female. There would be very little or no external penis. And so people would say, \"It's a girl.\" And they might, you know, have the celebration it's a girl. And I guess now they call them \"Gender Reveal Parties\" or something like that. I don't know about this, but anyway. They would reveal. The baby would reveal its external genitalia simply by being there and being naked when it's born. It has nothing to do with gender, it has to do with genitalia and sex. That baby would be born. And what was observed is that, from time to time, that baby after being raised as a girl, perfectly happy as a girl would around the age of 11 or 12 or 13, would suddenly start to sprout a penis. There's actually a name for this, it's called Guevedoces. Which the translation is more or less, penis at 12. And as strange as this might sound, it makes sense if you understand the underlying mutation. What happens in these children, these Guevedoces, is that the child is born. It has testes which are not descended, so up in the body. They're not making a lot of testosterone early on. They weren't able to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone because they lack this enzyme 5-alpha-reductase. As a consequence, the primary sexual characteristic of external male genitalia, penis, doesn't develop. And then what happens is the baby grows up as a young child essentially is treated as a girl. Generally they report being pretty comfortable as girls, although not always. And then testosterone starts getting secreted from the testes 'cause kisspeptin in the brain signals through gonadotropin and luteinizing hormone and travels down to the testes, the testes start churning out testosterone and there's a secondary growth of the penis. And all of a sudden there's a penis. And this leads to some very complicated situations in families and culturally. And actually the outcomes in terms of whether or not these children decide to self identify as males or females and how people treat them actually varies quite a lot. There's actually been kind of an adopting of a third category of sex and gender in these Guevedoces for in order to just offer them the opportunity to explore not just what would be a typical kind of girl or woman or boy or man phenotype, but something in between. Something that some people call intersex although intersex and pseudo hermaphroditism is actually a separate thing altogether. So it's fascinating and the point here is that dihydrotestosterone not testosterone is responsible for this primary growth of the penis. And that testosterone later is involved in the secondary sexual characteristics deepening in the voice, et cetera. Now this is where the information gets even more interesting",

You might think that testosterone because it masculinizes the body in the secondary sexual characteristic way. And because dihydrotestosterone another androgen, masculinizes the primary sexual characteristics. The growth of the penis early on, that testosterone must masculinize the brain. And there are in fact aspects of masculinization of the brain and body, that are independent of genitalia. Now it might be obvious to some of you, but some people probably don't realize that. Yes indeed the brain has receptors for testosterone. It also has receptors for estrogen. But the fascinating thing is that if you look at the brains of people that have Y chromosomes and that have testes and that make testosterone, and you look at the brains of people that don't have Y chromosomes or testes and therefore make far less testosterone in general, what you realize is that the cells in the brain that differ between what I'll call males and females, but between XY, and XX have receptors for testosterone, but the masculinization of the brain is not accomplished by testosterone. I want to repeat this. The masculinization of the brain is not accomplished by testosterone. It is accomplished by estrogen. Testosterone can be converted into estrogen by an enzyme called aromatase. This is vitally important to understand. Testosterone can be converted into estrogen by something called aromatase. I'll give an example of where this happens",

Testosterone goes up during puberty, for the reasons we talked about before. And some of that testosterone gets converted into estrogen by an enzyme called aromatase. Aromatase is made by several sources in the body. One of the main sources is body fat. So it can make a lot of aromatase. Sometimes you'll even see fairly dramatic breast development in males during puberty. Sometimes it's transient, sometimes it's not. The other place where you see this is in athletes and bodybuilders that take a lot of anabolic steroids. That take high levels of androgens. So they'll be taking testosterone at super physiological doses. Sometimes not always. They will convert some of that testosterone into estrogen and they'll get what's called gynecomastia. Which is the development of male breast tissue. Sometimes they'll get it cut out surgically. Other times they'll start trying to take estrogen blockers in order to try and suppress it or they'll try and block prolactin. It's a topic that we're going to get into in more detail. But what's important here is to understand that testosterone can be converted to estrogen by aromatase. Aromatase is not just made in body fat.

You might be asking yourself, \"How could tools possibly come up at this stage of the conversation where we're talking about sexual development and we're talking about the differentiation of tissues in the body.\" Well, this is true both for children and parents and adults. I want to emphasize that there are things that are environmental and there are things that people use in their homes sometimes that actually can impact hormone levels and can impact sexual development in fairly profound ways. And I want to be very clear, this is not me pulling from some rare journal have never heard of it. This is pulling from textbooks. In particular, today I'm guiding a lot of the conversation on work that on \"Behavioral Endocrinology,\" is a book by Randy Nelson and Lance Kriegsfeld. True experts in the field. I'm going to talk about some of the work from Tyrone Hayes from UC Berkeley about environmental toxins and their impacts on some of these things like testosterone and estrogen. I'm going to touch into them. I'm going to give some anecdotal evidence that's grounded in studies, which we will provide in the caption or that I'll reference here. One of those that's actually really interesting but helps illustrate the principle that we've been talking about is. A few years ago, there was a lot of excitement about Evening Primrose Oil. Evening Primrose Oil is in a lot of products that typically are associated with skin beauty and skin health. And so I'm generalizing here. But typically it was mothers or sisters that were using it. And there were actually examples starting to crop up of young boys getting accelerated breast bud development from skin contact with women were using Evening Primrose Oil. So Evening Primrose Oil is chemically a lot like estrogen and it has a lot of estrogenic compounds. There are a number of things out there like this. So believe it or not things like pine pollen look very much like testosterone structurally. They are more or less are testosterone. Their bioavailability in humans isn't as clear. Evening Primrose Oil has a lot of estrogenic elements to it. Just structurally how it's built. And so there were cases where boys were understandably you know, being hugged by their mom or maybe even like showering and taking. you know using the Evening Primrose Oil solution. Those things will actually change levels of estrogens in boys and girls. And so this wasn't just an issue for young boys. This is also an issue for young girls. So it's not that Evening Primrose Oil is bad, it's just that many of you have probably heard about the dangers of Soy Isoflavones and things like that. The impact of soy on estrogen levels is, there are some decent evidence to support that. However, there's a lot of other factors that are more severe. And one of those is this Evening Primrose Oil. So regardless of age, let's just put it this way because people might be wanting to drive their hormones more estrogenic or more androgenic. How could I know which what your preference is? I don't know. But in any case, things like pre Evening Primrose Oil can actually promote estrogenic pathways in the body and some of it can go transdermal. Likewise, because testosterone replacement therapy is fairly widespread nowadays. And some people accomplish that through cream. It's pretty well understood that, if someone's taking that they want to avoid contact with anyone. Skin contact with anyone that is trying to promote more estrogenic activity in their body. And especially in children. So that's one. The other is this issue of environmental factors.",

                "desc": "Environmental Endocrine Disruptors, Sperm Count Decline, Vincloziline",
                "transcript": "The other is this issue of environmental factors. Now this, you know, again I'm just going to highlight, when one starts talking about environmental factors and how they're poisoning us or disrupting growth or fertility rates it can start to sound a little bit crazy. Except when you start to actually look at some of the real data, Data from quality research labs funded by Federal government funded, not from companies or other sources, that are really aimed at understanding what the underlying biology is. And for that I really, we should all be grateful to Tyrone Hayes at UC Berkeley. I remember way back when I was a graduate student in the late nineties, goodness. at UC Berkeley. And I remember him, he was studying frogs. He was talking about developmental defects in these frogs that live in different waters around it was California, but also elsewhere. And he identified a substance, which is present in a lot of waterways throughout this country and other countries. So US and beyond. Certainly not just restricted to California, which is atrazine. This is A-T-R-A-Z-I-N-E. Again, this is the stuff of textbooks. And it causes severe testicular malformations. So again, atrazine exposure is serious. And what's interesting is if you look at the data, what you find is that at sites in Western and Midwestern sections of the United States 10 to 92% of male frogs. These were frogs mind you, had testicular abnormalities. And the most severe testicular malformations were in the testes rather than in the sperm. So it's actually the organ itself, the gonad itself. Now it's very well known now that atrazine is in many herbicides. And so you know, whereas I would say in the 80's and 90's the discussion around herbicides and their negative effects was considered kind of like hippy-dippy stuff or the stuff you hear about at you know, your local community markets and these kind of new age communities. Now there's very solid data, from Federally funded labs at major universities that have been peer reviewed and published in excellent journals, showing that indeed many of these herbicides can have negative effects, primarily by impacting the ratios of these hormones in either the mothers or in the testes, altering the testes of the fathers or direct effects on developing young animals and potentially humans. And so you ask, \"Well, what about humans? Frogs are wonderful, but what about humans?\" So here are the data on what's happening and this isn't all going to be scary stuff. We're also going to talk about tools to ameliorate and offset some of these effects. One would be, be cautious with Evening Primrose as well as testosterone creams, depending on whether or not you want to be more androgenic or estrogenic depending on your needs. But across human populations, sperm counts are indeed declining, okay? So in 1940, the average, the average density of human sperm was 113 million per milliliter of semen. That's how it's measured. How many sperm per milliliter of semen. In 1990 this figure has dropped to 66. So it went from 113 million per milliliter to 66 million per milliliter in the United States and Western Europe. So this is not just a US thing. Researchers also estimated that the volume of semen produced by men has dropped 20% in that time, reduced sperm count per generation even further. So between 1981 and 1991, the ratio of normal spermatogenesis has decreased from 56.4% to 26.9%. So there's a lot that's happening primarily because of these herbicides that are in widespread use to reduce sperm counts. And these are going to have profound effects not just on sperm counts, but on development, sexual development at the level of the gonads and the brain. Because you need testosterone to get dihydrotestosterone for primary sexual characteristics. You need estrogen that's come from testosterone to masculinize the brain. And of course, we're not just focusing on sperm and testosterone. You of course also know that many of these herbicides are disrupting estrogens in a similar way. Or are leading to hyper estrogenic, excuse me, states which might explain why puberty is happening so much earlier in young girls these days. So there are a lot of things that are happening. Now does this mean that you have to run around and neurotically avoid anything that includes things like atrazine and should you be avoiding all kinds of herbicides? I don't know that's up to you. But it does seem that these have pretty marked effects, in both the animal studies and in the human studies. You know, you can open up a textbook like the endocrinology textbook and find things like Vinclozolin. V-I-N-C-L-O-Z-O-L-I-N, which is a fungicide and it's an anti-androgen. You give it to animals, to rats. And instead of forming a penis, they don't form a penis. They basically, it's not that they form a clitoris, they just don't form a penis. So let's talk about female sexual development. And as always what we'll do is,",

Then we'll talk a little bit about a kind of extraordinary or unusual set of cases, but we'll talk about them because they illustrate an important principle about how things work under typical circumstances. So there is a mutation called androgen insensitivity syndrome. And understanding how androgen insensitivity syndrome works can help you really understand how hormones impact sexual development. So here's how it works. There are individuals who are XY, so they have a Y chromosome, that are born that make testosterone. They have testes and they don't have Mullerian Ducts because on the Y chromosome is this Mullerian inhibiting hormone. However, these individuals look completely female. And in general, they report feeling like girls when they're young, women when they're older. But there's something unusual that's happening in these individuals because they have an XY chromosomal type and not XX. So what's happening? Well what's happening is the testes are making testosterone, but the receptor for testosterone is mutated. And therefore the testes never descend. They don't have ovaries, they have testes but the testes are internal. And so typically these individuals find out that they are actually XY chromosomes. so that you know, their chromosomal sex is male. If you will. And their gonadal sex is male, but the gonads, the testes are inside the body. They don't actually develop a scrotum. They don't make ovaries. And when they don't menstruate around the time of puberty that's a sign that something is different. And so they never menstruate around puberty. And if they look into this deeply enough, what you find is that they are actually XY. They make testosterone but their body can't make use of the testosterone because they don't have the receptors. And the receptors are vitally important for some, for most all of the secondary sexual characteristics that we talked about. Body hair, penis growth during puberty et cetera. They live fairly happy lives as females. Although of course they can't conceive, right? They don't have a uterus, they don't have ovaries. They also in general, don't produce sperm in quantities enough that they could actually reproduce with somebody else, although sometimes they can. And believe it or not, and I'm not going to name names but there are actually reports of several people, fairly prominent people throughout history who have had this androgen insensitivity syndrome or people suspected they did. And the reason to not name names is that, it gets right to the heart of whether or not they are male or female. How could you say right? They have XY chromosomes but gonadally they have testes that are inside. And yet, if you looked at their bodies if you looked at their faces, you would say almost with certainty that they appeared female. And that naturally occurring experiment, points to the fact that testosterone that shows up in the body and impacts the things that the levels of the receptor has a profound effect on phenotype. On the external or body plan. So again, we're talking about this in order to illustrate the principle that in order to have its effects, a hormone doesn't just have to be present. That hormone actually has to be able to bind its receptor and take action on the target cells. And once again, I'll just throw out the example of where people are using performance enhancing drugs. Although that's a pretty broad statement, nowadays there's a lot of excitement about the so-called SARMs. Who are more on the receptor side. And so we'll talk about this in a future episode. And I just say that as a teaser because the SARMs and what's happening right now in augmenting sports performance, both with testosterone directly but also testosterone derivatives and then also altering things at the level of the receptor is exceedingly interesting and is revealing to us the many ways in which hormones can impact brain and body. In ways that we didn't suspect. Perhaps the simplest way to understand",

It's actually the closing sentence of an abstract that my colleague Neuronal Shaw at Stanford school of medicine published. Which is that estrogen, again it's estrogen that is aromatized from testosterone by aromatase, sets up the masculine repertoire of sexual, and in animals and in humans, territorial behaviors. So it sets up the circuitry in the brain. Estrogen does that. Estrogen sets up the masculine circuitry in the brain and testosterone is then what controls the display of those behaviors later in life. And I find that incredibly interesting. You would think it was just testosterone did one thing and estrogen did another, but it turns out that nature is far more interesting than that. Okay, so what are some things that impact sexual development",

                "transcript": "Okay, so what are some things that impact sexual development early in life and later in life. Let's talk about cannabis. Let's talk about alcohol and dare I say let's talk about cell phones. Something that I never thought I would ever do, either in this podcast or in the classroom. But, these days there are really interesting data. And I think you should be aware of them. First of all, cannabis, marijuana, THC. I realize that there are now a lot of different variance it's on this. There are a lot of different strains of cannabis. I personally am not a pot smoker. It's just not for me. I'm not talking about the moral or legal implications, in some States it's decriminalized, in other places it's really illegal and other places it's basically legal. You have to check, you know where you live and understand the laws. That's not what this is about. What we do know however, is that with the exception of one study there are many studies that point to the fact that THC and other things in cannabis promote significant increases in aromatase activity. Now pot smokers aren't going to like this, especially male pot smokers aren't going to like this but it's the reality. Remember, what you're hearing in the background is Costello snoring really loud? Should we put them on screen? He's not a cannabis smoker, but you can imagine why. Come here Costello. Come here buddy, come here. He's asleep. Come here. He's my [indistinct], there you go. This dog definitely does not need cannabis. This is his state for most of the time. He is highly... Oh he's asleep still. So some of you have asked to see Costello if you're just listening on audio, maybe he'll gives a [Costello grunts] Oh, okay. We're going to let him get back to sleep. He's always here, some of you have asked to see him. Costello's not a pot smoker either. He did have a dog sitter that was a pot smoker years ago. It was his favorite dog sitter but, I'm not a pot smoker. Again, no judgment. But here's the deal. That cannabis, and it's not clear if it's THC itself or other elements in the marijuana plant, promote aromatase activity. Now, this has been observed anecdotally where pot smokers have a higher incidence of developing something I mentioned before gynecomastia, breast bud development. Or full-blown breast development in males. There may be some women who want to increase their estrogenic activity. Remember females make testosterone. It comes from the adrenals, right? They don't have testes. So it comes from the adrenals and that testosterone can also be aromatized. Although typically most of the aromatase activity that we're referring to in these examples is in males. So testosterone can increase estrogenic activity. So you might say, \"Oh you know, therefore does testosterone reduce sexual behavior? Does it create all sorts of things that are related to low testosterone?\" Not necessarily, not necessarily. And here's why, estrogen itself in males and females is important for things like libido and sexual behavior. I'm going to repeat that. If estrogen is too low in males, it can actually inhibit libido and sexual behavior. So you don't want estrogen too high or too low. Whether or not you're male or female. Now of course in females, estrogen levels tend to be higher than in males. I'm speaking very generally here. You just think back to the chromosomal sex. That's what I'm referring to when I say male or female, although there's nuance there of course. In females, the testosterone that comes from the adrenals has a powerful effect on libido and desire to reproduce. And in the next episode, we're going to talk about how that works and its relationship to birth control, its relationship to menopause. We're also going to talk about how that whole thing works in males as well. But cannabis and other aspects of the marijuana plant can impact levels of testosterone and estrogen by increasing aromatase. And so people should be aware of that. As well, there are good data. I was able to find several studies on PubMed, pointing to the fact that smoking marijuana during pregnancy can shift the pattern of hormones in the developing fetus, such that it promotes more estrogenic outcomes. Now earlier I said that estrogen is what masculinized is the male brain, in utero that's true, but the way that cannabis seems to work, at least from the studies I was able to identify is that it promotes circulating estrogen in the body and therefore can counteract some of the masculinizing effects of things like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, on primary and secondary sexual characteristics. So I mention this because, you know I think nowadays marijuana use is far more widespread and certainly during puberty it can have profound effects on these hormonal systems. And so we'll do another episode, that goes really deep into this. But yes, cannabis promotes estrogenic activity by increasing aromatase. Almost everyone can appreciate that drinking during pregnancy, is not good for the developing fetus. Fetal alcohol syndrome is a well-established negative outcome of pregnancy. And it's something that there are cognitive effects that are really bad. There's actually physical malformation, et cetera. So drinking during pregnancy, not good. Probably drinking during puberty, not good either. Because alcohol, in particular certain things like beer but other grain alcohols can increase estrogenic activity. Now, this isn't just about protecting young boys from estrogenic activity. It's also protecting girls from excessive or even hypo estrogenic effects of alcohol in puberty. Now, many teenagers drink. College students drink and it's important to point out that puberty doesn't start on one day and end on another day, puberty has a beginning a middle and an end, but development is really our entire lifespan. This idea that you know, puberty you know has this open and close. That's just false. Okay, so we talked about cannabis. We talked about alcohol. Let's talk about cell phones.",

                "transcript": "Let's talk about cell phones. First of all, I use a cell phone. I use it very often. And I do not think they are evil devices. I think that they require some discipline in order to make sure that it does not become a negative force in one's life. So I personally restrict the number of hours that I'm on the phone and in particular on social media. I only answer email at particular times of day. But what about the cell phone itself? You know, when I was a junior professor. I was a pre-tenure early professor. I taught this class on neural circuits in health and disease. And one of the students asked me, you know are cell phones safe for the brain? And you know, all the data point to the fact that they were. Or at least there were no data showing that it wasn't. I still don't have the answer on that, frankly. I don't see a lot of studies about it. I'm not personally aware of any evidence in quality peer reviewed studies showing that cell phones are bad for the brain or that holding the phone to the ear is bad or that Bluetooth is bad or any of that. I'm just not aware of any quality studies. If you are aware of quality studies, peer reviewed study please reference them, put them in the comment section. Send them to me, however you like. I'd love to see them. I'm not aware of them. However, I was very interested in a particular study that was published back in 2013 on rats. It was basically took a cell phone and put it under a cage of rats and looked at basically testicular and ovarian development in rats and saw minor but still statistically significant defects in ovarian and testicular development. Since then and now returning to the literature, I've seen a absolute explosion of studies. Some of which are in quality journals, some of which are in what I would call not to blue ribbon journals. Identifying defects in testicular and or ovarian development by mere exposure to cell phone emitted waves. Let's just call that, we don't know what they are. And this sounds almost crazy, right? Anytime somebody starts talking about EMS and things like that, you kind of worry like, is this person okay? But look, the literature are pointing in a direction where chronic exposure of the gonads to cell phones could be creating serious issues in terms of the health at the cellular level and then in terms of the output. So the output for the testes would be sperm production. Swimming speed in sperm is an important feature of sperm health. In the ovaries it would be estrogenic output. How regular the cycles are. So in animals, the cycles are a little bit different than in humans. They don't have a menstrual cycle. They have an estrous cycle, which is a generally around four days. I think that it's to say based on the literature, that there are effects of cell phone emitted waves on gonadal development. The question is, what is the proximity of the cell phone to the gonads? Now, I've taken the literature as I observe it. And that of course we'll point you to in the captions. And I don't like to have my cell phone on and in my pocket, I'm well past puberty, but nonetheless some of these effects were seen in adult animals. There are effects now that have been demonstrated in humans. So let's just talk about a couple of those effects. So a paper published in the journal, \"Clinical Biochemistry\" from S. Gander et al. Looked at hormone profiles in people based on proximity to their phone and frequency of phone use, where they stored their phone on their body. Aa well as proximity of where they lived to, I guess they're called these radio-frequency towers. So the base stations. And they were looking at effects of radio frequency radiation RFR on human hormone profiles. And they show significant decreases in cortisol. You might say, \"Well, that might be good.\" But you need that morning cortisol bump in order to wake up. Morning cortisol is good. But also thyroid hormones were significantly reduced. Prolactin in young females, that's definitely concerning and testosterone levels in males and females. And so, there are now quite good data showing that being close to the phone too much of the day and how close is an interesting question or living near one of these base stations apparently can have effects on hormone profiles. And when you see a study like this one should always ask, \"Well, what are the other things that could also have effects on these hormone profiles?\" Right? Cause you could imagine that if you ran the same study of people that live close to a waterway, or close to a highway where there's a lot of exhaust from buses and cars, you might see similar effects. So you have to take these sorts of studies with a grain of salt. But I think it's very interesting. And given that the last time I looked into these data were way back when I was a junior professor and there was like one or two studies that I could find. One of the studies pointed to increases in testosterone in rats, where they were had close proximity to these radio-frequency radiation waves. And then in the other case, it showed decreases in testosterone. So there really wasn't any conclusion to takeaway from that. Now, there's pretty impressive amount of data pointing to the fact that there are effects of these things on hormones. I don't know what to do with that information. I'm not going to stop using my phone but, in light of the work from Tyrone Hayes and others looking at sperm counts and looking at the decrease in testosterone levels and sperm counts and fertility over the last 20, 30 years, perhaps it's you know, not surprising. Although there again, cell phones and smartphones have really been in prominent use mostly within the last 10 or 11 years. And so it's hard to explain all of those declines simply on the basis of cell phone use. There's some interesting effects of hormones",

                "transcript": "There's some interesting effects of hormones that actually you can observe on the outside of people, that tell you something about not just their level of hormones, but also about their underlying genetics. And these relate to beard growth and baldness. And it's fascinating. The molecule, the hormone dihydrotestosterone, made from testosterone, is the hormone primarily responsible for facial hair, for beard growth. As well, it's the molecule, the hormone primarily responsible for lack of hair on the head, for hair loss. So how does that work? Well, DHT circulates in the body and it binds to DHT receptors in the face to promote hair growth. But it binds to DHD receptors on the scalp to promote hair loss. Not incidentally, the drugs that are designed to prevent hair loss are 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors. So remember 5-alpha-reductase from the Guevedoces? Well, the people that discovered the Güevedoces, went on to do a lot of research on the underlying biochemistry of this really interesting molecule dihydrotestosterone. They identified 5-alpha-reductase. and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors are the basis of most of the anti-hair loss treatments that are out there. And so there's some interesting things here. First of all, the side effect profiles of those treatments for hair loss are quite severe in many individuals. Remember DHT is the primary androgen for libido, for strengthened connective tissue repair, for aggression. Even if that aggression of course is held in check, but just sort of ambition and aggression is related to dopamine, but within the testosterone pathway, less so pure testosterone, although pure testosterone has its effects. But DHT is, at least in primate species including humans, is the dominant androgen for most of those sorts of effects. And if you look at somebody, everyone can predict whether or not they're going to go bald based on looking at their, we're always taught our mother's father. So if your mother's father was bald, there's a higher probability that you're going to go bald. The pattern of DHT receptors on the scalp, will dictate whether or not you're going to go bald everywhere or just in the front or the so called crown type baldness. And the density of the beard tells you about the density of DHT receptors. Now this varies by background, by genetic background. And actually around the world nowadays, because people travel and people form couples and have kids with so many different people of different mixed cultures. You're seeing this starting to disappear. But there are areas areas of the world where all the men seem to have the same pattern of baldness, like a strip of baldness down the center, with hair still on the sides and and full beards. That's because these patterns of DHT receptors are genetically determined. Elsewhere, testosterone levels can still be very high, DHT levels in the blood can be very high and yet people will have very light beards or no beards. And that's because they don't have a lot of DHT receptors in the face. And in still other cultures you'll see people with huge beard, tons of beard. Their beards are growing all the way up to their eyes and they have huge heads of hair. And that's because they have a lot of DHT receptors on the face and not on the scalp. So there are a lot of effects of DHT that you can just see in male phenotypes. And it's interesting that these hair loss drugs that are, or to prevent hair loss drugs, are directly aimed at preventing the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone. And that's why they to some extent prevent hair loss, but also to some extent have, a bunch of side effects that are associated with low DHT. Along these lines there's a particular sports supplement that a lot of people use called Creatine. Creatine, now there's a lot of research showing that",

Might even have some important cognitive promoting. Cognitive enhancement effects, although mild. The studies there show that it can be significant. Some people, not all it's more anecdotal, report that creatine promotes hair loss. It differs by individual. For some people that's true, for others no. But yes it does appear, based on the studies I was able to find on PubMed, that creatine does promote 5-alpha-reductase activity and therefore the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone. And so it makes sense that it might promote some degree of hair loss, as well as beard growth, as well as the other effects of DHT. I recall in junior high school and middle school, going home one Summer it was seventh grade, coming back in the eighth grade and a kid that I knew that I was friends with, went from being like a young kid to, he was like a grown man, he had a full beard. It was amazing. It was like he would completely transformed. And in puberty as I've said before, is without a doubt the most accelerated rate of development that we will go through at any point in our lives. Even faster than infancy just in terms of the huge number of different cognitive changes and physical changes. Not surprisingly that same individual was mostly or bald by his early twenties. And that's because he must have had just exceedingly high levels of DHT. I also played soccer with this kid and he was basically like dribbling past everybody. It who was like a grown man, playing soccer with a bunch of little kids. Full beard you know, bald at 20. And so the rate of maturation, the rate of aging is very interesting.",

Beautiful work of David Sinclair at Harvard and others has pointed to this. The speed of entry and exit from puberty might be, I'm putting it out there as a hypothesis. Might be an interesting window, into how fast one is going through their aging or developmental arc. Because development of course, doesn't just start at birth and end after puberty. It continues your entire life. So I think it's interesting. You will often see that people, boys and girls. I should say boys or girls, will develop secondary sexual characteristics at different rates. And sometimes it's sequential. You know you might see a kid will, she'll grow very tall or she'll have a big growth spurt, but then breast development will come a little bit later. And then other features will come a little bit later. You can also see this in boys. The person that I referred to earlier, my friend that developed a full beard, you know, went bald. He was also quite muscular, he was a great athlete. So he went through puberty exceedingly fast. Other people go through it more slowly. Some people will go through puberty at age 14, but they won't start to accumulate facial hair until much, much later. Or their voice will change first, very early. And then they won't get the other secondary sexual characteristics until much later. And so, we don't really know how that impacts or relates to overall trajectory or rate of aging. But it's an interesting thing to think about for each and every one of us. I'm going to offer you the opportunity to do an experiment today, while listening to the podcast.

                "transcript": "hyenas, professional baseball and clitoris's the size of penises. So when I was a graduate student at UC Berkeley, we had a professor in our department, phenomenal scientist named Steve Glickman. Steve Glickman, had a colony of hyenas, spotted hyenas that lived, within caged enclosures of course, in Tilden Park behind the UC Berkeley campus. The enclosures are actually still there. I run past there fairly often. The hyenas are no longer there. This was a Federally Funded field station. These animals were brought over from Africa or were bred there. And the reason why they were hyenas in Tilden Park, enclosed in Tilden Park. Was because hyenas exhibit an incredible feature to their body, their hormones and their social structure. Hyenas, unlike many species, have a situation with their genitalia where the male penis is actually smaller than the female clitoris. And I should say that the male penis itself, having seen a fair number of hyena penises, is not particularly small. Which means that the hyena clitoris's are extremely large. This was well known for some time. It turns out that in these spotted hyenas the females are dominant. So after a kill the females will eat, then they're young will eat. And then the male hyenas will eat. As well, when the female hyena gives birth, she gives birth, not through the vaginal canal that we're accustomed to seeing, but through a very enlarged clitoris's like phallus. Although it's not a phallus, it's a clitoris. And it literally splits open. So many fetuses die during the course of hyena development and birth. These animals have this, what could only be described as a very large or giant clitoris. Although for a hyena it's not giant, it's normal. And it splits open and the baby actually comes through. The baby hyena actually comes through the tissue and it's it's a very traumatic birth. A lot of tissue is torn away, et cetera. And as I mentioned, a lot of baby hyenas die. It was a mystery as to how the female hyenas have this we'll call it masculinization, but it's really a androgen jet. Excuse me, androgenization of the periphery. Of the genitalia. And it turns out, through a lot of careful research done by Steve Glickman, Christine Drey and others. That it's androstenedione. What is essentially a pro hormone to testosterone? It's androstenedione at very high levels that's produced in female hyenas that creates this enlargement of their genitalia. So if you want to read up on androstenedione. Androstenedione is made into testosterone through this enzyme 17-beta-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase it's a complicated pathway to pronounce. It's a fairly straightforward pathway biochemically. You may recall during the 90's and 2000's there were a lot of performance enhancing drug scandals, in particular in Major League Baseball. And it was purported, although I don't know that it was ever verified. But it was purported that the major performance enhancing drug of abuse at that time, in particular players whose names we won't mention but you can Google it if you want to find out. Was androstenedione. And I actually recall long ago, when you could buy androstenedione in the health food stores. And so it was sold over the counter. So a lot's changed since then. But it's interesting that these hyenas, with these highly androgenized genitalia accomplish that through high levels of androstenedione in the females. Now if that's unusual,",

She was studying a species of mole that also lived in Tilden Park. People are going to start to wonder about Tilden Park, what's in Tilden Park? But this particular mole that lived there had testes for part of the year and had the capacity to trans differentiate its testes into ovaries in order to balance out the ratio of males and females in the population to keep reproduction at appropriate levels for that certain population. So some animals are actually able to adjust whether or not they have androgenized or estrogenized gonads, in order to adjust the ratios of offspring or the males and females in therefor promote offspring.

                "transcript": "And the last little anecdote about this, which is also published in the scientific literature, which is weird but I do find interesting. Hormones are so fascinating, they're just incredible to me is going back to the marijuana plant. You know, the marijuana plant has these estrogenic properties. And I asked a plant biologist whether or not this was unusual. And I asked because there's all this stuff out there about, \"Oh, you know, Soy does this. And these plants are highly estrogenic, et cetera.\" Although we should probably point out that a lot of factory meats are also estrogenic. So this isn't a meat versus plants thing. But this plant biologist told me, \"Oh yeah, there are plants that make what is essentially the equivalent of testosterone like pine pollen as it looks a lot like testosterone. And there are other plants that make what is essentially estrogen. And I said, \"Well, why would they do that?\" Well and you know plants, at least as far as I know, don't have a consciousness. They don't have a brain. They don't have neurons even but, his answer was fascinating. He said that, one of the reasons why some plants have evolved this capacity to increase estrogen levels in animals that smoke, not smoke it but then animals that consume them. I'm guessing that animals aren't smoking marijuana. Although I don't know, send me the paper if you've heard of this. Is that plants have figured out ways. They've adapted ways to push back on populations of rodents and other species of animals that eat them. So plants are engaged in a kind of plant to animal warfare where they increase the estrogen of the males in that population to lower the sperm counts, to keep those populations clamped at certain levels so that those plants can continue to flourish. Even if those animals are reproducing very robustly. And I find this just fascinating. And hormones therefore, aren't just impacting tissue growth and development within the individual and between the mother. Remember the placenta is an endocrine organ, and the offspring, but plants and animals are in this communication. And today we're in this communication, I'm telling you that there are certain herbicides that humans are using for which there's very good data, are disrupting the endocrine pathways. And so it's fascinating that humans and other animals, we're always in this interplay with plants and the other things in our environment. And hormones and adjusting the hormone levels of animals and plants is one way in which the environment kind of pushes back or pushes forward if you will, in terms of promoting their well-being and longevity, as well as you trying to promote your wellbeing and longevity. If anyone wants to see the incredible paper by Steve Glickman and colleagues. It was published in the proceedings of the national Academy. First in 1987, that's Glickman et al. That was the hypothesis that it was androstenedione . And then if you just Google Glickman hyenas science magazine, there's a beautiful cover article and feature all about that important discovery, it's a fascinating one. And I should mention also that those discoveries, both the moles and the hyenas weren't just impactful for the world of animal behavior and endocrinology, they've also strongly impacted understanding of conditions that show up in the clinic, which we haven't talked about today. Which is actually pseudo hermaphroditism. Occasionally babies will be born where it is unclear, if they are boys or girls based on the genitalia. And this has a very important ethical and other issues. Do you raise them as a boy or a girl? It's not super uncommon for this to happen. And there have been terrible cases where people have gone against the chromosomal sex. And the person was very unhappy with the the choice that their parents had made for them. There were also cases where they've gone with a chromosomal sex and the person was very happy about the outcome. There've been cases where they've been treated with hormones and there been cases where they have not been treated with hormones. It's a complicated literature and it has to be sorted out on kind of a case by case basis, but it is something that does happen. And the studies on androstenedione in hyenas and in these very interesting moles, pseudo-hermaphroditic moles that live in Tilden Park, have impacted not just the science but the therapeutics around those important issues.

                "transcript": "So now last but not least, I want to discuss the effects of hormones while you and I were separately in utero and the effects that that had on who we are, who we select as mates. So mate choice, sexual preference. And all other aspects of what you would call sexual development. Now this is something that's gotten a lot of popular press and it has to do with how exposure to androgens in particular while we were in utero, impacted whether or not people report as homosexual, heterosexual, identify as male or female. I'm very familiar with this work because I was a graduate student in the department that first published this work and I'm an author on the paper. I was not the main driver of the work, but I was involved in the work. And I certainly know the people that did this work. First it starts with a story. There was a researcher who's still going now. His name is Dennis McFadden. I believe he was at UT Austin back then. And he was studying the auditory system. And people would come into his clinic and he would, or his laboratory. And he would look at hearing and he would explore different aspects of what they call the psychophysics of hearing and understanding hearing thresholds and frequency thresholds. And he made several observations. And those observations were that young males tended to have what are called auto acoustic emissions, more often than young females did. Auto acoustic emissions, as the name suggests, are the ears actually making sounds. Now these sounds have to be picked up by a special apparatus, because they can hear into that frequency. But it turns out that your ears don't just take sound waves and convert them into this thing we call hearing. But they also in some cases make sound. So your ears are making sounds. Strange right? So it turns out that there's a sex difference in auto acoustic emissions. It turns out also that people that self-report as lesbians, they also have auto acoustic emissions significantly more than females that don't self-report as lesbian. And Dennis noticed this and published this. And it was an important discovery because it was one of the first discoveries that pointed to the fact that there are sex differences in biology that are independent of sex. I mean, this is hearing and auto acoustic emissions. And just to really illustrate what that. What the former problem was and why this study was so important? You know, a lot of people had explored for instance whether or not, homosexuals had lower testosterone for instance in males. And actually the result often was the opposite. That gay men or men that self-report is gay, often had much higher testosterone. And those studies then became controversial because people said, \"Well, sexual behavior can relate to testosterone,\" et cetera. And so it became very controversial. And then there were some studies that attempted to look at the equivalent phenomenon in people that self report as lesbian. Or self-report as heterosexual. And so it became very complicated. But this was an identification of a phenomenon, auto acoustic emissions, that was independent of anything that had to do with sexual or even social behavior. 1998 rolls around. And I'm a graduate student at UC Berkeley and a guy by the name of Mark Breedlove. Kind of an ironic name, given that he worked on. He worked and still works on sexual dimorphism in the brain and in the spinal cord and nervous system. And Mark, who's a phenomenal scientist comes running down the hall. I'll never forget this. And he said, \"Give me your hands.\" I was like, [indistinct]. He's like, \"Give me your hands.\" And he pulls out a ruler and he starts measuring my fingers. And he takes down a couple of measurements and then he goes away. And I was like, \"What was that?\" Well, I was in a course that Mark was teaching at that point. And soon after, we did a study that Mark directed exploring the finger length ratios. And I'll explain what those are. Of males and females, and people that self-reported as homosexual or heterosexual. So let's just get to the basic, what we'll call sex differences first. These are averages. I want to point out. Anytime you get into this kind of topic, people assume it's causal, but it's not causal. These are averages that I'm about to report. It is the case that the ratio of what's called the D2 to D4 digits. So the D2 is your index finger. So your thumb is D1. Then D2 would be your index finger that you would point with. Middle finger is D3, which you whatever with. And then D4 is the so-called ring finger. Okay and D5 is the pinky. It is the case that the D2 to D4 ratio is greater in self-reported females than it is in males. What does that mean? It means that digit D4 and D4 are more similar in length in females than in men males. And that effect is particularly, excuse me, pronounced on the right hand. Although not always, okay? And it does not have to do with handedness. This D2 to D4 difference has to be measured correctly. You can't just look at somebody who's hands and say, \"Oh, their ring finger and index finger are very similar. And therefore they are female you know. Or they were exposed to very little testosterone in utero.\" You can't look at somebody and see that their index finger is much shorter than their ring finger and say, \"Oh, they must've been exposed to a lot of androgen.\" You have to actually measure it and you have to measure it correctly. You have to measure it from the base of the finger where there's that first crease, all the way to the tip past the. You can't include the fingernails. If you're growing fingernails, it'd be logical here folks. So you can't normally see it from the back of the hand. Although, I don't know if this'll show up here but if you look at the back of the hand sometimes you can see it. You know, in my case for instance. Let me see if I can do this. So my D4 is a little bit longer than my D2. In some people it's more pronounced and that's on my right hand. On the other hand, the difference actually is far less pronounced. Is it's a little bit. it's a little bit pronounced there, but not so much okay? So that's sort of the typical ratio that you would see. It turns out that in mice and in humans, the more androgen that you were exposed to in utero, the smaller the D4 D2 ratio. Meaning that the ring finger tends to be slightly longer than the pointer finger. And in females because they're exposed to less androgen in utero typically. Then those fingers tend to be more equal in length. And these are subtle differences and these are averages. I invite you to look up the paper. This was published in Nature in 2000 and it's been replicated six times. Now, here's where it gets even more interesting. And potentially precarious, so we're going to step cautiously here. If you look at the finger length ratios of men that self-report as homosexual, they have either the typical male pattern of D2 to D4 ratio or a hyper masculinized D4 to D2 ratio. Now this can't be something that's established or modified by behavior. This has to be something that was established in utero. And in fact, it's present at birth okay? So it completely divorces the interactions between hormones and behavior. And that's an important theme that we've been talking about. And we're going to talk about even more. Next episode is that hormones impact behavior but behavior also impact hormones. But this is a case of hormones impacting what really should be considered a primary sexual characteristic. Because it doesn't show up in puberty, it shows up before puberty. It's actually established in utero. And in people that self-reported lesbians. And I remember going out there and collecting these data with, with the collaborators on this work. Again, I wasn't the main driver on the work. But I participated in some of the analysis. People that self-report as lesbians also tend to have a smaller D2 to D4 ratio. So this is consistent with the auto acoustic emission study that Dennis McFadden had published. And it points to the fact that early exposure to androgens may have an impact, not just on androgenization of the body plan, but also separately on sexual preference. Now, this raises all sorts of interesting questions about biological basis of sexual preference. I'll tell you about another study. A guy named Simon LeVay who was at UCLA. Who trained under Hubel and Wiesel.",

                "transcript": "Who trained under Hubel and Wiesel. If any of you remember early episodes on \"Plasticy,\" David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel my scientific great-grandparents won the Nobel Prize for discovery of critical periods for brain plasticity. They defined some of the most important aspects of how we see and brain plasticity. Simon LeVay trained with them. And then Simon went on to discover that in the brains of people that self-report homosexual there is a brain difference. And the brain difference is in an area called the Interstitial Nucleus of the Anterior Hypothalamus. So it's the INAH. And so there are published reports. That was published in Science. The other work I refer to as published in Nature, and then replicated no fewer than six times. And the McFadden results that point to strong biological correlates of mate choice, of sexual preference. And these tie directly to things like androgenization or estrogenization. Meaning we could call it maleness or femaleness, but that's sort of tricky territory. Because of the way that we described the huge range in which sex can be defined earlier. So, if you want to measure your D2 D4 ratio you're welcome to, but you also have to understand that it's not predictive of anything, right? It's just a window into the possible androgen exposure that you had early in life. There are plenty of men who report themselves as heterosexual who are out there who have similar or have D2 D4 ratios to females. And there are plenty of females whose index fingers are shorter than their ring fingers. And they're perfectly happy where they say they're perfectly happy. And we are inclined to believe them being heterosexual. So there's variation. In fact, Mark tells a really good joke. If you want to know whether or not somebody is homosexual or heterosexual, simply look at their hands, look at their D2 D4 ratio and guess heterosexual. And you'll be right 96% of the time. Because 96% of the time people report themselves as heterosexual on average. Those numbers might be changing. So the joke really is a joke on science because, that falls within the realm of statistical significance. And yet it really illustrates the fact that none of this is causal. But it's nonetheless very interesting because it means that hormones are organizing the brain early in development in ways that can potentially impact same or opposite sex partner choice later in life. Now of course, there are other things that can impact opposite sex or same-sex partner choice later in life. The study did not look at people who reported bisexual. There hasn't been a lot of studies on that yet. One thing that's very interesting, for which there are some good scientific data",

                "transcript": "for which there are some good scientific data but there's also some controversy is that, it appears that the probability of a male human self-reporting as homosexual, increases with the number of older brothers that he has. Now, that doesn't mean if you have an older brother or even if you have 10 older brothers, that you are sure to self-report as homosexual. But statistically it becomes more likely that somebody will with each successive older brother that they have. And the idea that starting to emerge, in the developmental neuroendocrinology landscape is that there's a record within the mother of how many male fetuses she's carried, because male fetuses are secreting certain things, dihydrotestosterone, other things, that can feed back on to the genome. So these could be epigenomic effects or onto the placenta itself, so that there's a higher probability in subsequent pregnancies that offspring will self-report as homosexual. So it's a fascinating area of biology. And as you've noticed today, none of this deals with the current controversies around gender and how many genders and sex, et cetera That's a separate conversation that is by definition grounded in the kind of concepts we've been talking about today and needs to take place, taking into consideration all of the aspects of sex and the effects of hormones, both on the body, on the brain. We didn't talk a lot about spinal cord, but we will in the next episode. But we can just say on the brain and the periphery, early effects, late effects, acute effects, meaning effects that are very fast of levels of hormones going up or down. Something that absolutely happens during and across the menstrual cycle. As well as long-term effects like the effects of these hormones on gene expression. So today, as always, we weren't able to cover all things related to sex and hormones and sexual differentiation or development. There's no way we could. But we have covered a lot of material. We talked about some effects of environmental toxins. We talked about potential effects of cell phone radiation. Something I never thought that I would be talking about, especially not in a podcast. But for which there are interesting emerging data. We talked about considerations about Evening Primrose Oil and its estrogenic effects. About Creatine and its pro DHT effects. About cannabis, alcohol. About plants exerting warfare on animals by increasing aromatase. The conversion of testosterone to estrogen. We talked about hyenas with giant clitoris's. And we talked about moles that can revert from having ovaries to testicles. And throughout this Costello has been snoring nonstop. He missed all of it. Although he might be learning it in his sleep for all I know. And I do understand it's a lot of information, a lot of detail as always. I just want to remind you, you don't have to absorb all the information at once. Next episode, we are going to be talking about the science of sex, the verb, actual reproduction. We're also going to be talking about",

sample size of one uh I realized that yes you are because you have this incredible skill set from your time in the FBI you but you also have an incredible understanding and knowledge of how to communicate about that skill set so that people can glean useful information from it you are also the guy that I text or call every once in a while and I've run myself into a jam or when I think I might be in a jam and I won't reveal details but you tell me whether or not things are okay unfortunately the last couple times I reached out you said you're good so thank you always happy to help man thank you well I have a lot of questions today but what I'd like to start off talking about is negotiations take many forms but if we could break those down into their broad categories that will be useful but before we do that I want to know about the mindset that you have when you go into a negotiation and whether or not there are any sort of practices I realize you've been in this profession a long time and so it perhaps became reflexive to you at some point but all of us at some point are going to go into negotiations business negotiations relationship negotiations Etc is there a process of getting one's mind and body right for a negotiation shifting from more listening and less talking or what are there any tools that you use on the regular that could be useful for us to keep in mind as we extend into the different categories of negotiations and ways to approach those negotiations and it can there can be a couple different um first of all just trying to figure out what what's really going on is is the real issue and then how can I get an approach where I'm most likely to get the best possible outcome um so there's always more than meets the eye and there's a certain there's a certain few cliches but the real issue is there's always a better deal or um there's no deal at all so first of all trying to my first thing is I want to find out whether or not there's a deal at all or whether or not it's a bad deal and then I'm going to walk away really fast because those are going to be complete waste of time um it's not a sin to not get the deal let's just send to take a long time to not get the deal what's the sin to take a long time to get a bad deal so I you know I want to know I'm going to try to figure out real quick whether or not is there Cutthroat on the other side of the table is it somebody I could trust I'm getting I'm leaning a little more inclined to dealing with the difficult people now as long as I don't give in so I gotta I want to diagnose early on what the possibilities are now if I'm curious if I'm actually interested now another aspect of the mindset is if I'm in a great mood like if I'm just gonna be playful a couple of really huge personal negotiation wins recently was when I was just trying to be playful I mean I was just I was in a great mood and I'm joking around and great negotiation is not exciting it's astonishing um I'm gonna come we're in conversations right now with a possible non-scripted TV show and so I was telling the producers you know this ain't going to be real housewives um for to make this show properly there ain't gonna be any screaming it's not going to be Bar Rescue where we're yelling at people we're not going to be Hell's Kitchen where we're yelling at people it's never going to be exciting but it is going to be astonishing you'll get outcomes where suddenly you find yourself in a place like what in the world how did that just happen and so I I lose a suitcase in an airport the other day and I'm walking into the lost luggage place and I'm in a great mood because I'm home and I'm happy to be home and I'm going to get a good night's sleep and even though it's late in the day I'm just happy and are you ready to walk into this the lost luggage store where these people are better children like they expect you they know that you expect them to wave a magic wand and proof your luggage is going to be there so for whatever reason that's what I say when I walk in the doors young lady says how can I help you well first of all how you could help me is obvious because I'm in a lost luggage there's only one reason I'm in here so that's kind of a silly question and I go I need you to wave a magic wand and she just laughs and she looks at me she ends up walking me out to the Carousel climbing up on the Carousel and she walks down a ramp the luggage comes out of and I guarantee you they're not supposed to do that and she sticks her head and she looks around she comes back out and I've never seen any of these people leave the office let alone walk back to the carousel and she says wait here and she she disappears into the bowels of the airport which like looks like a super highway down there right like God knows what it looks like underneath the airport and pretty soon the carousel starts up again and my bag and another bag pops out this other Porsche Mark is sitting there waiting and I'm like I have never seen anybody do this ever like normally they say here's a number we'll call you in 24 hours it might show up at your house and I look around at the uh there's another young lady there and I say you know please tell her thank you for me I gotta go because she she doesn't come back out for like almost 10 minutes and on my way out she she comes out the door and she high fives me and she says how does that for waving a magic wand and that was the magic phrase and I never would have said it to her if I wasn't playful in a moment and I've got a couple of others like when I was just playful and I'm joking with people almost at my expense it's shocking astonishing where you can get people to do if you if you hit them the right way so interesting I wonder what it tapped into but it sounds like it might have tapped into her sense that everybody's always asking me for a magic wand kind of ability but finally somebody just said it directly and that would be kind of fun to to actually play that role because normally they're restricted to their keyboard and their phone yeah you know I love that on the opposite side of that

dissolution of a of a contract or something like that do you ever have to check yourself like okay I need to I mean I imagine being calm is better than not being calm for most of most all things um uh do you have a process of doing that you seem like a pretty steady guy I've never seen you uh [Laughter] overall I'm pretty steady um well the late night FM DJ voice that um I'm not sure that I coined the phrase but kind of famous for to calm you down also calms me down so if I get bent out of shape um I will in a conversation gets heated I'll switch into that voice with the intention of calming you down because you know that's the that's the hostage negotiator's voice but it'll calm me down too like intentionally going to that voice tamps down the negative emotions which I'm convinced make me Dumber in the moment interfere with my capacity to process information got reasons for that Layman's reasons no scientific academically rigorous studies that have been in any journals well after you're done I'm going to tell you something that will perhaps be astonishing to you as to why there's real Neuroscience behind that late night FM DJ voice having an impact on other people's brains but yeah and I'll do that because it calms me down now if I can if I can make this shift the hard part is to shift into a positive mindset if I can make that shift but I can only make it from a calm voice I also think it's the emotions are kind of a rock paper scissors sequence I don't think you can go from sadness to Elation directly sad um depressed down I think there's something to um getting angry to pull you out of sadness and I think if you're angry you've got to go to calm next and so but if I can get out of anger and go to calm then I can say something to myself like the reality is this is a luxury problem or I was in a negotiation with a counterpart that I knew was deceiving lying to me and I remember saying to myself you know I'm lucky to be in this negotiation I mean they wouldn't they wouldn't be trying to hustle me if we weren't really good if we didn't have a product that was phenomenal I wouldn't be targeted at all so I'm actually lucky to be in this conversation so if I can make that next shift emotionally then I'm good the hard part is making those chefs I'm going to share with you what I learned recently about sound and emotion um I'm researching an episode on music in the brain fascinating topic believe it or not there's a lot known and the auditory system has this property where of course there are neurons nerve cells that respond to different frequencies of sound low low frequency you know deeper tones and high frequency squeals and that sort of thing right okay that's pretty straightforward just like we have neurons that respond to different different colors or different uh you know angles of light in in the room right but what I learned and I confirmed with a good friend of mine who's an auditory neuroscientist and and neurosurgeons named zetty Chang who was a guest on this podcast previously is that low frequency sounds of the sort that your voice is that late night fmdj voice are responded to in the brain by neurons no surprise there but the frequency that those neurons fire is also low frequency in other words when you speak in your low voice right the other person's brain hears that and starts firing in a low frequency tone right in other words it entrains to your voice not just the timing but it's actually like you're essentially playing an emotional piano down in the low keys of their all right of their mind now when you go up to the high frequencies the neurons can't follow that high frequency so there's something special about low frequency sound that actually changes the emotional tone of the people that hear that low frequency sound this is wild right I mean I mean of course the content of the words matters too but anyway there's there's real Neuroscience to support um the voice that you were endowed with and that you uh that you employed for your work well then and then also the point then too is it's not the other side's not making a choice it's an involuntary reaction that's right this is not something one can override except by perhaps plugging their ears right right if they're hearing that their their mind is getting shifted toward a state of low frequency oscillation which is one of more calm yeah so that yeah so that's a real thing and and were you to have a high squeaky Chipmunks voice you might not have been The Negotiator you had all that who knows maybe there'd be another tactic there I mean I I think back to the um uh what I guess it was during one of the Gulf War campaigns where they weren't they trying to um squeeze out uh Saddam and some of uh his people by playing like Milli Vanilli at high volume for hours and hours is that tactic actually used um so that was that was uh Panama when they were trying to get Noriega okay I'm only a few I'm only a few countries though see you know I had one ocean or I got the trivia you know I was telling you before and the wacky yeah fascinating useless information around terrorism and stuff like that I tried that at Panama and and for whatever the military guys they were playing music at and sounds and then also among the many stupid things that the FBI did at Waco then late at night they tried that in the Waco compound too and it was just that was one of the things that the hostage negotiators were adamantly against adamantly against but they got overruled um by answering command among the many stupid things that

                "transcript": "luck to talk about some different types of negotiations um oftentimes I think because you're a former FBI negotiator a terrorist task force this kind of thing um we tend to focus on the negative negotiations right get the hostages away and we'll talk about that stuff um breakups business deals that have gone wrong um people lying cheating what about negotiations that are benevolent let's say that two people want to um come to a true win-win around you know what they each see to be their best interests in let's say friendship two friends taking a trip together vacation who's gonna pay for what who's gonna pay up front are people going to pay each other back um or a romantic relationship two people are considering you know fusing finances to some extent or moving in together what sorts of questions should people be asking themselves prior to those negotiations in particular is it very important that people know exactly what they want going into a negotiation or I can recall many times when I've gone into life circumstances knowing I wanted a certain set of feelings or outcomes but not being extremely specific about you know I want this salary I want to live in you know in a west facing house on this particular location you know an exploration um of potentials I think can also take the form of negotiation so how do how should people think about approaching benevolent negotiations like where we're not talking about something tragic happening if it doesn't go through it might hurt it might be a little bit High friction but let's talk about how to get to a win-win yeah well there's a couple interesting things there first of all you know the phrase win-win because win-win is just great collaboration I mean an important fact it should be win-win which might only be emotional win-win now the phraseology win-win I know that if someone's opens a negotiation with me and they say right off the bat look I want to do a win-win deal with you that correlates extremely highly with someone who's trying to pick my pocket so I if you use that phrase in the first five minutes I already know where you're coming from you're trying to get me to draw my guards you when I lose so and this came up on our Instagram post I put up recently which is essentially watch out for the person says win-win now I didn't say win-win is bad I said watch out for the person that says it also you got to be cautious if if you're like some of the win-win mindset then people set themselves up to just get slaughtered by the person who's expressing a desire for win-win and looking to pick their pocket like if I feel win-win in my heart you go let's do a win-win deal if I don't watch it I'm like okay what do you want and then I find myself giving away the store so there's a lot behind the win-win phraseology that you have to have a complete understanding of and point of fact both sides should feel good about the outcome and isn't that the definition of win-win well kind of sort of but it's how they feel about it more than really what they got so in a benevolent negotiation among friends where are we gonna go to eat uh where are we going on vacation what route are we going to take people really just want to be heard out more than anything else which operationally seems to be I don't understand how it's going to make any difference makes all the difference in the world and how what's the best way for somebody to feel heard out well I'm going to start out by telling you describing to you not telling you but describing to you what my best guess is on your perspective because it's really calibrating me actually finding out where your position is and the only way I can find out where your position actually is I'm gonna I'm gonna increase you telling me if I start taking a guess at it first because you're immediately right away you you immediately going to tell me either I'm right or I'm wrong you're going to correct me correction is um is a satisfying thing to do and you're going to be much more candid with me if you're correcting me than if I'm asking you so I'll and you'll feel good about correcting me so it's gonna there's all these great emotional lubricants to me getting you to correct me so I'm going to start out by saying like here's here's what I think you're thinking here's how I think you're approaching this is what I think you're wanting out of this out of this not what you should be but what you probably are based on your perspective and that's going to accelerate the conversation exponentially like it's ridiculous how much faster things are going to go and then it becomes both an information gathering and a report building process simultaneously instead of separately which is what makes this approach faster even though it seems more indirect so if we're getting ready to let's say you're not going to take a car trip to Calif to San Francisco from here and I'm gonna say all right so my guess is you want to take the most direct route because you hate wasting time and you're probably going to say to me no no no I want to go up the Pacific Coast Highway because this beautiful stretch of uh country like I realize it's going to be a waste of time if we go up the Pacific coast because we got to jump off it at some point but I really want to see the scenery you would have I've taken a guess of what you want and you're going to come back real quick and correct me and then maybe I'm thinking time on the trip but I've forgotten how beautiful it is to roll up the coast and so when you throw that out I'll be like oh yeah it is a beautiful ride and we might not get another shot like who knows what's going to happen so yeah I know now now that we're having a conversation I'd rather run up the Pacific Coast Highway before we before we go Inland and make the trip and that's how we get to um we collaborate for a bit a better outcome maybe a better idea than what I had in mind in the first place I love that because what you just described is hypothesis testing yes it's the way scientists are training you know many people don't know this but they teach us in science not to ask questions but to start with a question like you know how does how does the brain develop or something and then you say a hypothesis and you test hypotheses and you figure out if they're right or wrong and that takes you through a set of decision trees and you eventually get it what you hope is some core truth um and then hopefully others arrive there as well and you get a consensus so I love the idea of hypothesis testing in fact when you said uh take the most direct route from where we are now in Los Angeles to San Francisco I like to take one-on-one not the five the five is faster so I immediately think but I like 101. first of all there are a couple really great taco and hamburger spots along the way that I used to stop with my bulldog and yeah also you get to see the coast and it makes those extra two hours completely worth it and so you're exactly right in um in that working through the decision tree doesn't necessarily mean um presuming that the the hypothesis is right it sounds like you'd be equally okay with the hypothesis being wrong because really what you're trying to do is just learn and in learning set up this collaboration I love that a couple of things first of all when you talk about hypothesis and when when my son Brandon was involved in a company he's on he's out on his own now but he used to always say hypothesis test your hypothesis you always use that term and then even now like we were talking about it and you just said you knew some hot dog and hamburger places I'd be like holy cow I didn't even know that yeah yeah I want to check those places out so that's how you discover new stuff in a conversation I love it so um and also I'm sure people are noting to not say the words win-win When approaching any kind of negotiation what do you think it is about those little um catchphrases that that signal lack of authenticity or trustworthiness because you could imagine that somebody you know I come to you and say you know hey Chris like let's um I don't know let's do some collaborative thing for social media for podcast and um this is gonna be a win-win for both of us now I know to never say that with you but you could imagine that somebody really means that yeah but for you it sounds like it's a flag that um they're trying to pull one over it's it's uh it correlates really strongly with the people that are definitely trying to cut your throat and I've had I've had him admit that to me candidly amazing like I'll be um I've experienced it like if somebody throws win-win out early to me I'll say all right I think I know where this is going but let me explore it and they'll say yeah you know this great opportunity for you that's another tile and we're going to put you in a room with all these billionaires and there's going to be all this opportunity for you if you just come in and speak and you know we don't have a budget well I've gotten that one before yeah the famous the famous uh the world will just work out in your favor because magic because it's going to work out in my favor right yeah yeah exactly right I mean I've been on the receiving end of those offers many a time um fascinating conversely what sorts of

                "transcript": "shifting slightly into the more let's call them high friction negotiations or the types of negotiations where there is the potential for a truly bad outcome right um I know you've been asked this before but some of our listeners are going to be learning about you for the first time do you recall of the many negotiations that you did while in the FBI any one particular negotiation that felt like if this doesn't work out this is really catastrophic and would you be willing to share that with us well um I learned you know they tried to teach this early on that not everything's going to work out and the second negotiation I had in the Philippines uh the first one uh uh a young man named Jeff Schilling was grabbed by terrorist group uh Abu sayef and he ended up walking away because we still we stole the bad guys long enough that we just you know sometimes if you can slow it down you wait for something good to fall out of the sky and it will and that ended up happening in that case and a bad guy ends up calling the negotiator that I coached on the phone after it was over to basically tell them that they still had a good relationship it was nuts um why does a bad guy call The Negotiator that was responsible for him losing everything and say you know you did a good job which is exactly what happened so we roll into a case um and I hadn't had anything go bad at that point in time the very next case said Burnham some Barrel case uh by a different faction of the terrorist group 13 months later ends up in um two or three remaining hostages shot killed by Friendly Fire uh on along the way hostages have been executed America have been executed early on and it was it was a train wreck and lots of people got killed all along the way and just really ridiculous bad things happening and that that was bad all the way through um so we learned you know learned a lot from it um went back and checked everything we did and we didn't do anything wrong that we felt based on our strategy didn't didn't miss anything and that was why I ended up going uh collaborating with the guys at Harvard because my reaction was if this if we did everything we know how to do and it wasn't enough that means we're not smart enough we got to get better and so that case taught me a lot about the Dynamics that really happened on the other side and the difference between you know whether or not people are really on your side the US government was not highly collaborative uh the Philippine government was not highly collaborative that everybody wanted to get their pound of flesh out of the other out of the other side I mean just everything bad that you can imagine early on when Grandma sabero uh was murdered by the Abu sayif it was a national holiday in the Philippines and the bad guys had a history of killing people on national holidays and we weren't from the Philippines and we had no idea that that day was a national holiday and we showed up at uh Philippine national police headquarters in Manila and it was closed now we got it on I got an ongoing hostage case with bad guys threatening to kill hostages and we show up at the gates and the gates are closed and we're like what the hell's going on here it was the national holiday nobody's working today I'm like first of all nobody told us that secondly I don't think the bad guys really care that it's a national holiday and nobody's working our negotiators nowhere to be found we got a we got a guy there that um uh the previous negotiator we worked with Philippine national police was not that happy that they didn't have him under complete control so they give us a guy that will not tell us anything until after he's told them so he's having conversations with the bad guys and we're actually hearing about him second hand he didn't show up that day and then and of course that day the bad guys announced they're going to kill uh kill a hostage and give it as a gift to the country of the Philippines because it's a holiday and then go oh by the way they like doing this on holidays and so and and Grandma Sombrero ended up getting his head cut off with the because of all the warring factions on our side of the table not telling each other what the hell's going on so I had assumed at that point in time that people would tell us the stuff we need to know we didn't need to ask and and after that I got like look there ain't nothing here that I don't need to know I don't if it's a holiday it's coming up then you assume I know you got to tell us so really learned a lot about collaboration on our side of the table and also the lack of collaboration on the other side of the table just because we're a mess doesn't mean they got their act together and the bad guys didn't have their act together and ultimately the hostages one of the reasons someone didn't come out because internally they they had double crossed each other so learned a lot about what really fundamental human nature Dynamics are on teams and your team has not got its act together and the other team does not either so what can you do as a communicator to make up for that really learned a lot about that in that case I had cases subsequent to that involving Al Qaeda when Al Qaeda was killing people on a regular basis but we saw those coming and we did everything we could do to keep the train from smashing into US you see a train coming down the tracks you know it's coming down the tracks and you do the best you can to derail it and sometimes you can't I've heard it said

one of those three yeah that's very true and as The Negotiator trying to rescue the hostage is it important to identify early on which of those three or which all of those three um thereafter like how serious they are are they willing to actually kill the hostage are they um you know will they go for any amount of money above X number of dollars right right I'm trying to figure out their threshold right I mean because the person is on the other side is gambling right they're gambling their their freedom they're gambling their um reputation with whoever their reputation matters to um is it important to get into the mindset of the person you're negotiating with quickly um using the hypothesis uh generating method um and if so uh could you give an example of how that played out in in your previous work yeah the um uh the indicators are really there I mean once you sort of uh lose your Illusions about how you things how you think things should play out then the patterns of behavior are generally pretty quick uh and clear and just because you don't like the patterns like with Al Qaeda we recognize the patterns and knowing what they are doesn't mean you can change what they are and Al Qaeda in 2004's time frame was very clear about killing people on deadline and we had to recognize that so there there becomes a pattern of behavior and it's usually specificity in what they say and this is this is all this is all human nature like if if you're in a business negotiation and they say you know we're gonna do something horrible here you know we're gonna walk out you know that's fairly non-specific and if they say look if we don't get this by this specific deadline if we don't get these specific things met by this specific time that's pretty specific that it's specificity you're looking for it I learned to look forward in kidnapping negotiations we're working a case again in the Philippines and a bad guy say you know if uh if we don't get a ransom for the sun 17 year old boy at the time is kidnapped you know you tell his father he's going to lose an egg and that's you've you've euphemism for losing a child and early on when that threat came through on our side of the table everybody's like oh my God they're going to kill him you know this is really bad we got to make sure the family can pay the ransom I'm like no no no it didn't it didn't say when it was going to happen they didn't say how it's going to happen they didn't say who was going to do it you know the basic specificity of who what when and where like they left themselves and out here a very clear out and we never said we were going to do it we never said when it was going to happen we never said which child you know what they're just trying to scare you they're throwing out something back I said we got we got plenty of time to play with this we gotta we gotta push this all the way through the process into the end now later on in that case when the family tried to deliver a ransom and it was screwed up by God knows who the bad guys came up back on the phone and they said if we don't get paid tomorrow your son dies and I said all right now that's specific and these guys sound like they mean it and so we're going to have to make sure this thing goes down tomorrow or that's the end of this kit and at that point in time we allowed the family we were in a position to allow or disallow we were in a position to offer thoughts and our thoughts were they mean it now and you need to do something now or likely something bad is going to happen and now that they're this serious because you always got to worry about what we used to refer to as a double dip do they take the money and then and they come back and say no that was a down payment that wasn't the ransom that was just a down payment you got to make sure you don't get double dipped if you let the family pay and you got to give me your honest opinion as to whether or not they're going to let the hostage go if you pay now and our our thoughts were you Pam tomorrow your son's coming out and he did the double dip is a scary thing to hear about um at a much lower level meaning more minor level um people sometimes get shaken down online you know like their password will get taken there are people everywhere who go for the click on this link you know you get a text message you know we've identified that your account has you know been changed verify you click on the link takes you someplace where you put in your login and password and boom it's gone and then they try and sell it back to you typically through cryptocurrency because it's not traceable by the way those those negotiations can be a lot of fun if you let them well I'm hoping that our discussion about this now is going to save some people uh the trouble of having their their accounts hacked I've known people who've had their accounts hacked and these are some smart people but what's interesting is that I've also observed those situations where somebody gets to the point where they say you know I'm just going to give them what they want and I I remember in this one particular instance saying no no do not give them the money because then they're just going to say they want more there's no there's no guarantee that they're going to give you back what you want right and why would they right if you think about it why would they the money funnels in and like they just can pivot and go to the next thing so how do you um gain confidence that you are likely to be double dipped or not um well first of all I got to find out if you know if they're in a position to carry out the threat or if they're in any sort of legitimate position to begin with you know for lack of a better term it's Proof of Life and there are a lot of people that are trying to scam you but they don't really have the ability to scam you so you got to find out you know do some confirmation do they do they have access to your account do they do they have your data they have your money do they have it in a position are they just trying to make you believe that they have that position of influence on you um there are a lot of a lot of the bad guys out there that are just rolling a die styling for dollars if you will and if they don't scam you when they have no leverage on you they'll find somebody else that'll give in so there's a bit of you know authenticity or or are they in a position to do it and um the same rule applies in any negotiation um the other side is going to give in when they feel like they've gotten everything they can kidnappers I'd be asked by an ambassador asked by an FBI Commander when's it is going to be over when the bad guys feel like they've gotten everything they could not when they did but when they felt like they did so our job is just make them feel it sooner so you know how how hard you make it innocently on the other side everybody everybody wants to feel like they did a they got a good day's pay for a good day's work so if you let them feel like they're in charge and you make them work by asking them innocent how and what questions which are very hard and fatiguing to answer then you're going to get to the point where you're going to get a solid outcome where you don't get double dipped and they're going to be happy that it's over because they felt like they got everything they could it could be your data could be your bank account um could be anything the other side is going to be satisfied with the outcome when they feel like they worked for it and in business negotiations you're selling your car and some you put a price tag on your car and a guy walks up to you and says I'll give you full amount right now what's your reaction I should ask for more um maybe I won't sell my car you know every human interaction the other side wants to feel like that they earned what they got and so the idea of empathy and hostage negotiations is really just to make them feel that sooner we're going to come back to empathy",

fundamental nerve in US yeah you know they want to help to be a rescuer right so um is that a good rule of thumb for people to keep in mind to to not I think that's a great rule of thumb I mean I I A friend of mine um somebody got a hold of his phone number not that long ago and um I was getting texts from his number so I'm like look man I got some real problems look I need some money from you now who's a friend a friend's number and I remember when I first saw it actually if when I first saw it I was really busy and I felt bad that I didn't get back to him that day and then I didn't hear from him again and so I thought well whatever it was you worked it out so a couple weeks later I get the text again you've got a real problem you got to get back to me right now so I'm I'm I decide if it's really my buddy I am gonna help him right now I gotta make sure it's really my buddy and I said hey man you know uh you didn't raise this at all last time I saw you in Vegas because I'd seen him in Vegas recently and he's like yeah you know I was busy I couldn't bring it up and something like ours so there's no direct confirmation or denial we had we had breakfast together in Vegas so then I shoot back I said like and man I got to tell you something that was such a crazy night and I still owe you money from them so you know that night when we were gambling I I still owe you money I'm happy to help now it wasn't a crazy night it was breakfast and I didn't know money and his next response was like yeah don't worry about it you know you can make that up from from to me with this so I'm like all right cool so now I start making stuff up and I said you know and when we were with those strippers and that dog and the clown and the pony I'll never get over that and so now the guys what are you talking about and I said by the way and then I started throwing in some stuff about his wife and his mother and the guy got insulted and called me names and stopped texting me and then I then I sent all those text messages to the real guy including you know what I'd said about his mother and he texted me back he's got a great sense of humor he says by the way my mom does think you're attractive oh man I think but I start I started it all by just checking the source if it was my friend I would have helped him immediately and I need to throw something at him that's going to confirm that it's him and then I'm there for him but I'm also going to have put a little bit of a curve in there that that if he doesn't catch I know it's I know it's a con and then I'm gonna have fun with it incredible knowledge that you know people will hear this and they might think oh you know that's never going to happen to me but like I said I've known family members and friends who they make the mistake they take the bait of clicking on the link and then now they're getting the Shakedown um actually a good friend of mine said that her parents called at some point her parents probably in their late 70s now um someone had called their house and told them that their child this woman had been um kidnapped right and that they needed to send money right and that if they called the police they'd kill her or harm her in some way right so they started sending money and they were afraid to contact her and you can see like what a bind a a loving parent would be in right they obviously don't want to get this child of theirs hurt and they obviously are willing to do whatever it takes in order to get them back turns out it was total scam right because eventually there was communication that made me realize that their daughter was perfectly okay and never even interacted with kidnappers so those kinds of scams happen pretty often I've had that happen to a friend also yeah so the sense of urgency should have been the first flag that's a that's a great Point yeah absolutely yeah and look look even if they've got your loved one the secondary issue is if you do what they want are they going to let them go which is actually a legitimate question like if they really are bad guys one of the things we learned in hostage negotiation that I applied a business negotiation there are legitimate questions that it's okay to ask you're not being disrespectful you're not pushing back there's there are fair you know to use the F-bomb Fair legitimate questions that you can ask under any circumstances which is basically you know if I comply is this going to work out the way that you're articulating it anything that adds communication into it which gives you more information to find out what the ultimate outcome looks like even in kidnappings how do you know that how do you know that if you pay they're going to let them go that's a legitimate question there are examples somewhere in between you know getting your Instagram account hacked your bank account hacked and you God forbid your child kidnapped for instance there's a whole practice within the legal profession of probing to see whether or not somebody is going to give up money to avoid a lawsuit for instance right this is a actually a lawyer friend of mine",

                "transcript": "actually a lawyer friend of mine recently described their job very well he said in his words first person he said I scare people for money the operative word being scare people it's being an ant being honest yeah he's being very honest he scares people for money and he's very good at it and um and he understands how other people scare people for money and he works both sides you know and uh plaintiff or defense type situations but you know it made me realize that you know a lot of the legal profession is not okay the lawsuit slid across the table it's the okay here's what the lawsuit would look like here are all the statutes that potentially were were violated and then there's a probe of like what somebody's finances are and you know how much they're willing to pay and do they have liability insurance do they have an umbrella policy all the sorts of things that are that are really it's not necessarily an illegal Shakedown but it's you know a probing as to whether or not you know there's it's worth the effort diagnosing the other side's ability to pay you're right and so that happens really often I can give a specific example where um somebody had a incident at a dog park where their dog um allegedly ran into somebody maybe charged at somebody you know dog park people are standing around and the person moved and and apparently injured their knee but rather than sue the owner of the dog what they typically do is deliver some set of documents that say you know I was injured your dog was responsible for this um and if you don't settle up for X number of dollars you're going to be sued for usually an exorbitant amount above that right right and then there's this question that the the lawyers have to figure out like is it puffery right are they saying I'm going to sue you for four million dollars is there any basis for that and good lawyers will say that's puffery they're they're trying to scare you with a big number but a lot of people see that number and go oh my goodness what do they want you know what like I don't even know if they were injured if they were that's terrible I'd want that taken care of if my dog's responsible I'd want that taken care of but what what do they need in order to make this this go away right and that happens millions of times a day throughout the country and a good portion of those probably happen here in California because there's a that's kind of the way the legal system is arranged right so this is not somebody um you know it could be somebody manipulating the law it could also be somebody who's being entirely honest about their experience of being injured by somebody else's dog so under those conditions I mean it sounds like the same set of rules apply you want to know how serious they are do they have a case so to speak that's the work of the lawyers but in assessing how serious somebody is you said you it's fair you called it the f word I like that I'll never forget that it just ask a fair question like like how much money do you think you deserve or um is that would that be a good example of a very direct question uh or is it um How likely are you to walk away if we don't give you the money like you know is there I mean because I can imagine there's all sorts of reasons why people would be dishonest about about answering those questions well and then uh how much money do you think you could deserve uh you deserve is is a really good question not necessarily what the answer is but how they answer it you're going to get how quickly they fire back and whether or not they stop and think about it how and what questions typically are best to judge these other side's reaction and the answer is secondary because the how or what question causes what we would refer to as deep thinking slow thinking Danny Kahneman behavioral economics thinking fast and slow slow thinking is in-depth thinking you ask a how or what question to make the other side think first and judge their reaction to how they think about it and do they actually do they actually think about it or do they fire right back at you that gives you a clearer picture of who you're dealing with where the outcome is going to go how much money do you think that you deserve if they immediately you know 10 million dollars all right so this is I got a Shakedown artist on the other side or they say all right if they stop and think about it and they give you a thoughtful answer that's a completely different person on the other side you're asking a question to get a to diagnose how they respond first the answer is second and sometimes I if it's a Cutthroat on the other side I'm going to start peppering them with how and what questions just to wear them out that's passive aggression if I if I got a Cutthroat aggressor on the other side I'm going to drop into passive aggressive Behavior to slow him down and where I'm at um one of my hostage negotiation Heroes a guy named Johnny Pico was John Domenico Pico not not Johnny like Johnny Rockets Italian Johnny John Domenico got all the Western hostages out of Beirut in the mid 80s wrote a book called Man Without a Gun negotiated in person face to face with Hezbollah the only guy that ever did that got everybody out and in his book he wrote one of the great secrets to negotiation is learning how to exhaust the other side and when you've got a really dangerous adversary on the other side of the table you don't go nose to nose you don't argue you don't you're not combative you wear them out exhaust them and if you get somebody really combative or Cutthroat on the other side start peppering them with how and what questions because to even think about the answer it tires them out and it's passive aggressive and it's deferential and it really works so if the person on the opposite side of a High friction negotiation is aggressive the goal is to slow things down fatigue them yeah and get them to just either relent or to reveal something that's that's a loophole yeah right yeah if if I have to make the deal then I'm gonna wear them out I'd like to take a quick break and",

                "transcript": "I'm interested in drilling a little bit further into this process of wearing them down and the passive aggressive way of reducing The aggressors Stance and I want to highlight for people that you know what we're talking about here isn't you know manipulation to extract something we're actually talking about the reverse we're talking about a bad actor who's aggressive and trying to um de-fang that bad actor yeah yeah what is that process of wearing them down look like or sound like could you give us a couple of examples of let's say I'm the bad actor we could play this game I won't be very good at this um and I am saying look I want X number of dollars by at this date or you're not going to get what you want they're gonna die or disappear it's that simple and I'm you know a Stonewall kind of approach what is the approach that you take to wear that person down well what what a they're going to be how questions that are mostly how and what and they're going to be legitimate questions which is how do I know you're going to follow through what does that look like like if I do what you want how do I know you're going to follow through so get them to talk about the alternative okay so if you were to well if you deliver by that date I'm gonna pass them to you without fail like if they're just getting kind of brief answers where the person is just again this kind of like rigid Stonewall approach yeah well and so there's a phrase that we use all the time Vision drives decision so if if you're really going to comply if I if I give in and when I said how do I know you're gonna you're gonna follow through I'm not talking about the threat I'm not trying to get you to clarify the threat I'm trying to get you to clarify what implementation looks like so I need to know I'm based on your reaction to that if you plan on following through if I comply you will already have that in your head or be open to it Vision drives decision you've thought it through in advance what does letting the hostages go look like if you do if you have no intention of ever released releasing a hostage if I follow through then you're not going to be able to answer the question or and you're probably going to throw it back on me really quickly and so then now I know like all right so you got no plans on complying if I give in you're not going to comply so I but you still want the money then I'm gonna ask well how am I supposed to pay you if you don't have any plans for compliance and if you're willing to entertain a conversation about what compliance looks like it was a kidnapping that my unit worked just before I was in it in Venezuela where they weren't entirely sure that the bad guys were gonna the farc I think had had the hostage they agreed on an exchange point to let the hostage go that was some distance from where they had a pretty good idea the hostage was being held so they figure they're not going to drag the hostage all the way to this River Crossing if they're not going to let them go it's just too much effort and then it was one of the few times there was going to be a simult theoretically a simultaneous exchange but they're going to have to send the money across the river before the hostage was let go so if we agree to this all right so they're not going to drag this this guy all the way to this River Crossing they don't plan on letting them go and if it's a long way to drag them and they got their money do they want to drag them back like even if they're ambivalent once they get there if they've gone through all the effort to get to the meeting location and the hostage is there we've now just increased the chances significantly they're going to go ahead and comply because it's a pain in the neck to take them back this is all human nature stuff human nature investment how do you get them to engage in actions and behaviors and then verbal commitments that actually mean something to them when I was working kidnappings the very last thing we always have the family get the bad guys to say it last not first but last we'd actually get a verbal promise to let them go again at the end because we've been talking to them long enough at this point in time we got a pretty good idea what they sound like when they're lying and what they sound like when they tell them the truth if somebody tells the truth they pretty much tend to tell the truth the same way every time if they tell the truth you talk to somebody long enough you got a line on do they ever tell the truth and if they do what does it sound like people lie 20 ways they tell the truth one way so we've been coaching the negotiations with the kidnappers long enough that we know what they sound like when they tell the truth so when they ask at the very end if we if we paid you promise to let them go it's not that the answer but how they answered it and that that'll be the last thing to seal the deal you know how do you continually stack the odds in your favor for implementation do you have a bodily",

                "transcript": "for implementation do you have a bodily like a somatic sensor for lying uh the reason I ask is years ago I had the experience of knowing somebody and uh they turned out to be a generally good person but I sensed early on that something was like off I couldn't relax around them right I just couldn't relax around them and and I could not tell you why but it was as if my I couldn't even identify the neuroanatomy of it you might say it was the vagus nerve or something but I teach in her anatomy and I can't point to one pathway in the body there was something about my autonomic response that would just start cranking up when I was around them like something is off something is off something else and I and I kid you not five years later five years later I discovered a series of lies that all ratcheted together that were actually pretty meaningless in the total context of things but I remember thinking at that moment oh my goodness like my my system knew like new and you know for all my knowledge of Neuroscience I can't tell you to this day like what it was in in the in my biology but it had something to do with my bodily response it wasn't just a thought like that doesn't quite add up or I feel like I'm getting the run around or or this it was it was a physical sensation are you familiar with that experience yeah well it's a little bit uh what you guys and your colleagues are still discovering the science behind the gut and what we're actually teaching you know my company now we're teaching people learn the difference between your gut and your amygdala for lack of a better time your fear centers and know which one is which and listen to your gut your gut is ridiculously accurate now where where does that information come from one of your podcasts recently I was listening to who were talking about Olaf Factory juice right the smells like I never thought of that of course you know yeah they're the the um uh was a term for the um the the molecules that you're putting off that that oh pheromones oh pheromones gonna get kicked out like of course and that's why some of the great investigators I knew would say I can just smell it I can smell it so what all is feeding your gut and what what are the senses that the science hasn't yet discovered you know you can't you can't make me believe I'll I will never believe that the life force stops at the surface of our skin that there's energy and that we can pick up on the energy I mean our gut is being fed by all these different inputs that we're aware of or that we have yet to be made aware of that tonal voice doesn't match their their words the the head tilt you've got a super computer in your brain your gut is incredible if you could listen to it instead of your Fierce centers and as soon as you start listening to your gut you can't explain it at the time but you gotta you got a bad feeling in your gut and later on then you saw it all it all came together where your brain was picking up these cues your your brain was probably when you're in their presence there's got to be an odor somebody gives off when they're when they're intentionally deceiving you don't you didn't know that that was a smile and maybe you you couldn't have consciously smelled it but you're still picking it up so long answer to I'm a very big believer in in the gut I think there's science that we know and yet to discover that tells us that the gut is just ridiculously accurate if we listen to it instead of our fear centers I completely agree that there are energetic exchanges that Neuroscience can't yet explain the field of Neuroscience that is is starting to explore some of these things um there's basically uh three Apex journals the most competitive journals to publish in science nature and cell and I only mentioned that because there was a series of Articles written in Science magazine about Magneto reception in humans you know the idea that humans can detect magnetic fields sounds like quackery right Turtles can detect magnetic fields they migrate by them actually long distances but the idea is that humans can't do that and yet there are some well-controlled studies where people have to guess about the orientation of a magnetic field and they do it better than chance not everyone can do it but some can do it better than chance in a way that cannot be predicted by anything else except some inherent form of magnetoreception in their nervous system so there are capabilities of the nervous system that are starting to be revealed for which we don't have a lot of evidence but there's enough evidence to suggest that these things are really happening um the other example which you might find interesting is a little bit uh more a little less esoteric but there's a beautiful paper published in one of the cell press journals a couple of years ago showing that when people listen to the same story the distance between their Heartbeats tends to be very similar now it doesn't mean that their exact heart rates are similar but if you look at the distance between their heartbeats they all entrained to the same Rhythm the same song and get this they're in completely separate rooms these experiments are being done on completely separate days and yet if I were to line up just you know the distance between the the heartbeats for you they would line up like a set of columns wow for dozens of individuals listening to the same story so you know clearly there's a passage of energy from things we hear and things we see that goes into our nervous system at a level that's below our conscious detection here's the last thing I'll say about this we have a series on Mental Health coming out not Mental Illness but mental health um by the uh I think to be among the very finest psychiatrists in the world Dr Paul Conte and he said you know we all think that the forebrain is the super computer right he said no the subconscious is the super yeah yeah that's where the real knowledge processing is happening that's the iceberg below the surface where all the real heavy lifting has taken place and that people who learn to tap into the subconscious can learn to use that information in very meaningful ways and I think that's what you're describing he's been on with you before right he has to talk about trauma in particular and he was on Lex Friedman's podcast as well the series that we're doing with him is not about trauma per se it's really about the subconscious and the self I think you'll find this series really interesting yeah and it has a number of very practical questions that one can ask themselves about their subconscious and and kind of work the process of Psychiatry we're excited to release that series but it um because I don't know of anything like it that's been put out there into the public but but I was so um pleasantly surprised to hear him say you know we all hear that the the forebrain is the super computer it's what drove our Evolution he's like no no no it's the it's the subconscious that's where our real wisdom resides and the forebrain is just the implementation device so it's uh you know uh how we can convince ourselves that that we're in charge right yeah I mean I can't think of a time that my gut told me a and it turned out to be B more often than not though I've suppressed my response right I override it thinking I think I made the mistake that you guys train your negotiators to avoid which is I thought well this is making me anxious and the anxiety must be like me like this must be my fault or I'm not able to call myself in this situation um not sleeping well Etc and um and therefore like this much must represent some deficiency on my part and then um and Lord knows as your shirt points out I'm I'm a very flawed person I have many flaws I always say I have 3 000 pet peeves and at least as many flaws to match those that piece I wonder when at least relationship but um the point being that I think our bodies really do know they know yeah yeah yeah yeah I would agree so when you're doing",

that's been done on my company called tactical empathy nicknanton uh 122 23 Emmys the filmmaker dnf DNA films it was finished last year it's not out yet for a variety of reasons we haven't put it up so that we screen the thing in Vegas last year I see it I love it I'm not a good judge of a film about me I'm going to love it no matter what it's about me but I tell Nick that night oh man I love it this is great two days later I find out I realize there's a huge problem I've already told them it's okay so I gotta get him I gotta I'm gonna text him and then I'm gonna call him and we got to fix it now it's a Sunday text message I sent him a two-line text it's now bad time to talk I get something you don't want to hear two lines now what were my other options I could have called him Nick and I got a great relationship I call him if he's in a position to pick up the phone doesn't matter what he's doing he's going to answer the phone he was in the middle of a zoom call if I'd have called he'd have picked up during the zoom call and both conversations would have been bad he immediately fires back to me I'm in the middle of a zoom call I'll call you in a half an hour he already knows he ain't gonna like what he's going to hear I'm prepping him for bad news get him on the phone like look I know what I said we got a problem we got to get Derek on camera Derek is a guy in my in my team and I I'm shocked that I haven't made him part of the documentary this is going to be incomplete without dare we got to get Derek on on film we can't show this to anybody else until we get him on film and make a part of it immediately he's in problem solving mode he goes okay I got to get a crew to Derek or get Derek to a crew I need to know when we can do that I need to we gotta we got another showing of the film scheduled in La less than a month away he says I got to get Derek on camera and we got to edit it it's going to take three weeks of editing I said I'll get you access to Derek's camera he goes done or there's calendar he says done it's done we go through this whole conversation in less than 10 minutes now think of the normal negotiation hey Nick how are you what's going on today are you in a good mood hey hey hey how the kids doing all this time wasting conversation if I'd have set him up with that normal he would also he he could have legitimately said are you out of your mind we've been working on this for a year you didn't bring this up in a year not only that you already told me two days ago at the at the showing in in Vegas that you loved it and now uh a year year and a half into this project you're bringing up all these new problems that would have been the normal negotiation but since I since we got a highly collaborative relationship I two line text we're done in 10 minutes now since Nick's a very generous guy when he gets done and he says by the way you understand how much this is going to cost me it's just three weeks of editing this is three hours of shooting and three weeks of editing I go yeah he goes but I'm happy to do it calls me back the next day he's got a favorite asking me you got it doesn't matter what it is because we'd gone through what would have been a very complicated negotiation that started on taxed and I sent him a two-line text on a Sunday and we got to solve that fast so if I understand correctly by setting the context in a very direct and succinct way right he goes into it in a problem-solving mode with you whereas if you do the um the tour of all the things that are going well in life yeah yeah the sort of the um we'll keep this uh PG you know the the um the mud sandwich approach you know you know they teach you that you know when you get a laboratory you know most scientists have no skill running a business right you get a laboratory all you've done is experiments and then suddenly you're in charge of people managing budgets and all this stuff I mean I mean most scientists 99 of scientists are completely unqualified to do the job they do at the level of running a laboratory when they start you learn it on the job and eventually you end up having to let somebody go and they'll and so the typical thing they teach you in these online training things is you tell somebody something nice then you give them the bad news and then you tell something them something nice on exit right that's kind of the the mud so to speak sandwich right all right um this is not that what you're talking about is saying hey this is the problem you're not going to like the problem or there is a problem you're not going to like it so that they show up with the context of solving a problem as opposed to giving them the tour of all the things that are going well and then the problem is really in contrast to that and then it's like uh you know so so you what I love about what you're describing is it's it's just it's direct it's honest you're not doing the uh the tour of the garden before you take them down to the um to the septic tank it's what I would call the difference between being blunt and being a straight shooter a straight shooter tells you the truth they just tell it in a way

                "transcript": "I agree thank you for that there's a concept that a lot of people haven't heard of and I'm confident in saying that because I hadn't heard of it until recently despite spending a lot of time in the literature around dopamine and motivation and it's a term from psychology that is being used a little bit more now um and it's ego depletion yeah it's an interesting concept and I've been wanting to run this by you for a while but I saved it for our discussion today it turns out ego depletion is a lot like decision fatigue um you know we've all heard the Steve Jobs thing you know he wore a black turtleneck every day because it you know he didn't have to make that decision so he had more energy to make other decisions I've been accused of doing the same because of my black long sleeve shirts but there's a whole other reason for that that um some people might know but anyway it's unimportant in the moment um but ego depletion is a little bit different than decision fatigue or decision budget the idea with ego depletion is pretty simple it's that the molecule dopamine does many things in the brain but one of the things that it absolutely does is it holds us to goal directed Behavior that's associated with a sense of self like I want to accomplish this I want to get to that and the whole notion of ego depletion involves the the idea and this has been a data substantiated observation that when people have to fight to be right or to defend their position for a period of time eventually that depletes and it seems to be at least in part dopamine mediated because defending one's position takes work right you earlier you talked about running somebody down you know um wearing them out and I wonder as I just throw this concept out to you a cold here whether or not that calls to mind any examples from your work where you felt like okay like this person could really hold but if I just kept pressing eventually they tilt right you know and it's different than the kind of fatigue that comes from a conversation that starts at three in the afternoon and ends at 2 30 in the morning we've all been there right I've been in those conversations usually they're not very pleasant and at three in the morning everyone's peeling apart you just I've learned over the years you know like you clip it at 9 30 and you try and shift right right you know one of the worst pieces of advice I've ever heard um is you'd never go to sleep angry it's like no actually uh actually get sleep wake up and then revisit the problem if the situation allows that's my uh that's my uh yeah um trying to stay up all night trying to work something out it's just counter biology so ego depletion um I have a feeling a lot of what you did in your profession was um running down their dopamine to the point where then they are operating from a different place where they're not defending the ego they're actually thinking more practically about the whole situation does it have any kind of texture of meaning to you yeah no I would I would agree and I would draw the distinction uh first of all in hostage negotiation there's there's two kind of Hostage takings um if there's a demand um and it's going to be contained and uncontained which is just literal definition contained as bad guys in a bank like at the Chase Bank in Brooklyn way back when you got them surrounded they can't get away and uncontained as a kidnapping you don't know where they are uncontained unknown location we're going to try to get our way in a contained situation probably by ego depletion wearing them out get them to the point where they just I just they're just going to give in because they're tired because they're going to come out we're going to put handcuffs on them um which means that if the ego gets recharged they're going to go back in there think they're going to think back over the deal so wearing somebody out in a business negotiation it's basically uncontained because even if you come to an agreement there's a whole implementation phase they're going to you did you did you get the agreement because you warm up because they get tired because he just gave in at some point in time they're going to get recharged and they're going to get recharged while you're in implementation so they're either going to not going to follow the terms of the deal or it's the slightest opportunity they're going to deviate and so yeah I think Eagle depletion is is a real thing and it's a bad way to get a business deal that's going to stick because they rest and then they come back yeah a different person yeah yeah they're going to be recharged their ego is going to be recharged and if you get the if you got the agreement based on a depletion of the ego that battery is going to get charged back up again whether it's a business deal whether it's a personal negotiation you know you have a disagreement with your significant other and you you follow that bad advice don't go to bed angry and so you stay up till three in the morning and you think you come to a resolution everybody gets a good night's sleep the next day they feel completely differently about what they said the night before yeah I might have heard of that happening once or twice it's not in a movie right yeah I saw it in a movie like a friend explained that situation to me",

                "transcript": "to me um earlier you mentioned approaching a conversation in a playful way right like all right you know this might even be life or death but let's play this like a game because you can see more opportunities now we know that when we are relaxed we see the big picture when we're tense everything Narrows there's a tunnel vision tunnel thinking tunnel everything we lose access to the full tool kit so you obviously take really good care of yourself you're fit you're in shape you always seem calm I'm sure you have your moments like anybody else but um what are some of the things that good negotiators do all the time so that when the bell goes off and they have to respond they are ready and the reason I ask this is because you know we've been talking about negotiations in kind of a vacuum like it's happening and then how does one handle it but like any athlete like any teacher like any parent like any kid everybody has to be ready for real life circumstances and we don't always get the warning we don't get the memo that it's happening in two weeks and sometimes the conversations around courtroom drama or the big day you know it implies that we we get the warning but more often than not it's a phone call or a text and it comes in and boom it just hits us and suddenly we are in negotiations and we didn't get time to prepare right so maybe we could talk about readiness and then we could talk about again like maybe this sounds trivial to you but for me I'd be very curious to know whether or not you have any practices of stilling yourself what those look like um what you've seen other people use to to be able to get themselves into the moment of being able to show up their best self yeah well um Readiness small space practice for high stakes results like I will occasionally find myself in the middle of a negotiation that I didn't expect if I've been throwing out stuff on a regular basis on my way during the day verbal observations what we refer to as labels because the label seems like something just crossed your mind is a label in the middle of a negotiation when I see you hesitate or look to the side how do I get ready for that you know I'm I'm on my way over here to this interview um I'm both talking to my Lyft driver the whole way getting them to talk also being careful about not tapping the gas tank out completely so that I'm fatigued when I get here like I talk I talk about the Lyft drivers on a regular basis I um interactions TSA guys in the airport I'll throw a label at them seems like a tough day tough day seems like you're in a good mood and whether right or wrong I'm getting in I'm trying to stay loose I'm trying to keep the mental muscles limber and it just becomes a bit of a habit on a regular basis occasionally I'll throw something out now I'm talking about Lyft drivers like if I'm in a bad mood I I get into a lift couple of weeks ago on my way home Lyft driver is not helpful I mean I'm coming out of the airport I'm struggling my bags not lifting a finger it doesn't open up the rear I gotta open up the rear of the vehicle myself I got to load the bags everything I get in and he's just seething unhappiness now I know that if I say what do you love about what you do for a living I immediately trigger what Tony Robbins would call a state change and I'm annoyed at this guy and you know our pheromones are combative but I'm thinking like I just I just don't need this and so I go what do you love about driving for left this guy proceeds to unload on me on all his personal struggles that I feel like a complete jerk for being angry with him at everything that he's going through and I'm just trying to get myself out of bed out of a bad mood and to keep from sending him a really negative vibe the whole way so that he doesn't drive 45 miles an hour in a 65 mile an hour Lane and make it you know inflict me with a longer and more expensive ride because I'm so annoying as a customer but I've got a habit of small Stakes practice for high stakes results and who do I get to practice on the Lyft drivers on a regular basis the guy behind the counter at the hotel uh the TSA guy I'm going through TSA the grocery store clerk the Starbucks person the only way I'm at my best in my negotiations is just trying to keep my negotiation muscles limber by interacting with people throughout the course of my day and then ideally you know leaving them better than I found them you know try and try not to leave negative karma in my wake trying to leave as much positive karma in my wake as possible I love that and I'm very familiar with the feeling of needing to conserve my voice for podcasting or energy for things and yet I'm somebody who's I think genuinely curious about what people's experiences are so I like the question um you know how's your day going it's pretty open-ended um it's I suppose if somebody was really upset that would be perhaps the worst question I could possibly ask um from what you just described but I don't put a fine point on it too because like I've manipulated him with what do you love about because there's it you watch them change in the moment to immediately to shift into this concept of love which is more than like what do you like about driving forklift what do you love about driving for left I I can trigger a state change in you instantaneously no matter what kind of mood you're in because this guy was in a very bad mood plus Additionally the download from that typically is so quick I'm going to get a real clear picture on who you are really really fast I'm talking to a CEO of a company a couple of months ago they're they're the you know for lack of a better term they're delivering clean water to the world and I'm like that's a cool Mission like I dig this as an entrepreneur an entrepreneur want to make a dent in the universe I dig that like I'm trying to make a difference in the world so I say to him what do you love about what you do for a living immediately fires back at me I love leading teams I Love Leading teams and I love giving shareholders a great return on their investment it's really important for me to give shareholders a great return and then yeah you know we deliver water and then he said a fourth thing and I thought this guy could be doing toilet paper he doesn't care about the mission of the company at all he's a great CEO probably because you want a CEO to lead teams you want a CEO to deliver a corporate CEO to deliver a return on investment for shareholders but that's why he's a great corporate CEO and not a great entrepreneurial CEO so by him giving me that download real quick that was blatantly honest like do I think this is a great guy yeah do our core values line up my mission is more important to me than his mission is or his mission is making money now I like making money but it's not number one it's a strong number two but that question instead of how are you today to what do you love about you immediately put them in a better place plus you get some ridiculously candid answers that tells you who they are real fast what is the best way to approach",

                "transcript": "what is the best way to approach our response to somebody who's asking to be heard perhaps they've got complaints maybe about us maybe about somebody else you know people are venting right people seem to vary on the propensity to vent Spectrum some people just you know they vent all the time this happened that happened and you know and they want to complain you know the uh the way it sometimes describes they love to take other people's inventories they love to take inventories of everybody else's mistakes they did this they did that um you know it's it's a lot easier some often than taking our own inventories of what we could be focused on and do better that's that's a universal truth in my mind but you know people approach other people that they trust and they want to vent presumably to get over whatever it is that is bothering them but all too often it seems to just amplify the feelings of frustration what do you do when somebody you care about and that cares about you comes to you to vent is it just you let them you let them vent or do you um do you try and let them negotiate with themselves a little bit in a way that could help them more than if you were to just let them vent I'm really leery of letting people vent because a lot of times it just they never it seems to be a spiral that just spirals out of control um so how do why is somebody vented they don't feel hurt they feel ignored they feel like they've been wasting their time talking they're frustrated that's the feedback I'm gonna give you feedback on what I'm guessing cause is causing you to vent in just an observation like it sounds like this is this is driving you crazy because nobody listens to you sounds like you've been struggling with us for a long time sounds like this is very frustrating for you um what's the emotion the particular negative emotion frustration is about somebody being denied a goal in the future anger is about somebody who's upset about something happening in the past the type of negative emotion begins to focus you in on where they is it Forward Thinking or is it backward thinking and frustration and anger can be two very different versions of the same negative emotion but they're focused on different points in time so I'm going to try to intuitively if I don't if I don't know um from what you've told me I'm going to start taking educated guesses on making an observation on what it is that's driving you if you need to vent you've been talking and people been ignoring you or you've been taking actions and people have been ignoring you it's a it's you need to vent because your communication reactions have been ignored there are some Clues here and the sooner that I get at the heart of what's bothering you the sooner you're going to be able to let it off so I'm going to encourage letting the steam off without trying to correct you without giving you advice um without frustrating you by not listening to you by trying to recognize verbally what some of the motivators are which will deactivate the anger much more quickly it's the whole basis for a crisis hotline to begin with people are venting and so how do you most effectively vent somebody so that instead of going on a rant for an hour and the rant introduce toxins into their system where they're poisoning themselves I think negative emotions put toxins in our system you know how do I deactivate that as quickly so that you're not hurting yourself as much and and you you feel heard you feel relieved you feel listened to so I'm gonna and if it involves me if it's a close friend who's venting to you you're involved in a situation to some degree and I might even say boy it feels like you're probably frustrated because I haven't listened to you up to now you know I'm going to talk start taking some emotionally educated guesses on what I think is driving you and I'm gonna put in the form of a label which is just an observation seems like sounds like looks like then if I get it wrong and you go that's not it at all I can say well that's just the way it seems it just seems that way it puts you in a position to to just let somebody know you see them and you're doing your best to understand I'm I'm not a fan of venting I if if I go on a rant personally I always feel worse so I want to deactivate that negativity so I can get get my feedback under me emotionally very useful knowledge you just shared with us do you meditate tiny little bits I mean and trying to make my day more effective I have a gratitude exercise that I do almost every morning um other ways to make myself effective I actually I'm looking at the non-sleep deep rest practice over the because I you know I like to make use of my time so and you know I'm spiritual so um I'm I'm talking to the almighty on a regular basis you pray I do yeah the morning and night when you need to both yeah both I mean I think you know whether or not you believe in one God or the universe or whatever it is I think spiritual spirituality is an important component of Health whatever your spirituality is you should recognize it and you should you'll be better off if you engage in some sort of a spiritual practice doesn't have to be any of the three major religions you know but spirituality is a component of who we are so yeah I practice it on a regular basis so a sense of higher power or um to better Define higher power it could be as you said with aligned with conventional religion or just aligned with the idea that there are things outside of us that are important to pay attention to that we can all do better by being in recognition of or service to or or both yeah something like yeah pretty much pretty much like that and and then leaving it as open and as as possible because there I think there's a spiritual nature to us period I agree what about your physical training I I",

Lambs at the beginning she's running around uh with other agents yeah um shooting targets and running and lifting and doing their sit-ups and they're you know that was a I think it was a 1980s film so it was a little bit dated now probably now they're they're doing other stuff as well um but you know nothing nothing works like the basics so um was the FBI the first time you got serious about Fitness or prior to that were you in were you an athlete and into fitness and what are you doing nowadays to maintain your frankly impressive shape um well thank you for the compliments um Sports Athletics Fitness was always a part of my life I was into sports but not particularly good at them uh football basketball um then you know I'm a last century guy so long before the conditioning is involved as evolved as it is now with interval training and the rest of this stuff which is phenomenal you know weightlifting was introduced to my high school my senior year you know I lifted weight some continued through college a little bit of time in a martial arts ripped my knee apart in college in the martial arts but yeah Fitness has always been a part of my life as much for liking to be in condition and you know the spiritual regeneration of it whether I knew what it was or not um these days you know I'm looking for every hack there is I know you don't like the term hack not well we like mechanisms scientists like mechanisms yes yeah hack sort of implies that we're using one thing to accomplish something different I like mechanisms but at the end of the day if people want to call something a hack because it gets them the result they want or they're more it's more appealing to it to apply the tool that's what matters to me you know tools sitting in a box don't do anything so people are using them then I'm good with the term yeah yeah so what these days cold plunge sauna principally I'm struggling with issues with a couple of joints that I know science will eventually help me regenerate so in the meantime good diet you know the basic pillars diet uh not a uh not a perfect diet but by and large overall my diet's pretty good um and then you know the uh the little little things spiritual keeps me in shape physically the hitting a cold Plunge uh is is challenging psychologically and physically and the state shifter that's for sure you don't need science to know that uh 30 seconds or a minute in that cold water is gonna change your Chemistry for a long while afterwards and for the better I believe yeah once you get out people forget this they're like I hate they call it the whole the point is not how you feel while you're in it you can feel proud of how you navigate that portion but the point is how you feel afterwards right well I feel the old saying why do you hit yourself in a in the hand with a hammer because it feels so good when you stop like that I like that um smoking like somebody worked in New York City for a long time um out here we'd probably say something different um you know it's like crystals and lava lamps or something although there are many lava lamps anymore I think that the idea that California is all hippie dippy that's not true anymore I think it's been overrun by by other um a different ethos in any event um thanks for sharing that because I think that we can't separate the physical from the psychological right I mean we've been talking about the mental and fatigue status of the people you're negotiating with oftentimes during this conversation but then of course there's how you show up to the job I mean if you're run down three days and you've been in a fight with your spouse and that's still in the back your mind and you're um and you're hungry tired sick what you know um not connected to your higher power all those things that there's no way you can be as effective at any job so I it's great to hear and not surprising to hear that you have um Bedrock practices that you you implement um especially yeah it's interesting point almost everybody I knew that it was really good at anything they did for a living they probably took pretty good care of themselves yeah I agree you know there's this that the language around self-care I think gets really distorted I'm going to editorialize for a second here I think it um but I'm going to editorialize in line with with what you just said um you know I think self-care sounds like Naval gazing where people think that it's all about self but it's actually taking care of oneself so that we can show up better for everybody else more energy more capacity more staying power to have those hard conversations with the people we care about and that move our life forward so it's really refilling the the fuel tank in my mind as opposed to um the kind of uh egocentric narcissistic you know stance that a lot of people take towards that they and and I understand why they do you know people scroll through Instagram and they see um people you know selfieing every every muscle and like and all this stuff and listen I'm not disparaging what people want to do but but at the end of the day self-care is about being more ready to do better for the world if you're or if you're Mission oriented agreed completely agree do you think there's been a change in",

eating hoagie sandwiches and um you know and uh looking through binoculars and running themselves into the ground with like this kind of bulldog-like persistence to get to solve the puzzle I mean put differently I imagine there were some negotiations that were very long and fatiguing so um do you recall one of the longer negotiations that you had and how do you sleep at night Midway through a hostage crisis um so the longest one that I was I was directly involved in on almost day to day and hour to hour one when it went about three-ish days Washington D.C 2003 start of the second Iraq war guy named Dwight Watson rolled the tractor into the middle of DC and claimed he had four bombs and he left four bombs scattered around the city had he actually done that or he was just call he was bluffing he was bluffing he hadn't done either um and started on St Patrick's Day kind of interesting a couple you know like that like the thing in um uh you said in was in of the Philippines it's like national holiday yeah holiday right interesting uh for a whole bunch of reasons now I and and I had to go home and go to sleep uh when one night and when we're in the middle of that and then it was just I don't remember having trouble going to sleep because I felt like I did a good job um and that we handed I handed the shift off to another hostage negotiator for the bureau was effectively the team leader of Vince stefanzo and Vince was bringing a negotiator so and the team that he was with I you know everybody was in good hands as a matter of fact Vince almost kicked me out of the scene because I didn't want to go and he just kept saying go home get some sleep go home get some sleep and finally the fifth time he said it to me I went home so I felt like I was leaving uh things in really good hands and we're working kidnappings we expected them to go for long periods of time and you just you just kind of gotta it if you have faith in the process and you feel like that you're doing the best it can be done then I think you could sleep at night um I guess to answer that question you you have to be careful whether you're working a a case of Siege or um anything in in the bureau that you don't run yourself into the ground and there was some cases I worked in the 90s where I mean like we we knocked ourselves out like we would we worked harder anybody we ever saw but we occasionally we took time off too you know I worked with guys that realized that sometimes you got to go out and have a beard kick back and blow off some some steam so I think everybody that I ever worked with were occasionally cautious enough to recharge the batteries and then depending upon the nature of the challenge in front of you it was a Siege in Saint Martin's Parish and went six days I don't think those guys got a lot of sleep but the nature of those sieges in that particular type of sea generally lasts five or six days anyway you just gotta gut it out were there ever instances where you're just trying to keep the person on the line so they can just raid you know I I know I never had to do that personally you had to be prepared to do that from the very beginning of any Siege that you might have to get some you might have to orchestrate an assault of some sort I was fortunate enough early on in my training there's kind of a famous Siege in if you know hostage negotiation history in London called a princess gate Siege where um a legendary British hostage negotiated David Van Ness had the bad guys on the phone while the SAS was hidden hitting the building and I remember that we were shown like look there may come a time when you have to keep somebody on the phone when SWAT comes in that goes with the territory so expect that's a possibility from the very beginning and it was a great Siege um the bad guy Saleem the photos of him after he was shot the phone is within his reach David kept him on the phone I've heard the tapes the breaching explosions were going on and um slim says I gotta go I gotta go there's suspicious noises and David Van Ness in his classic British accent said Salim there are no suspicious noises now let's get back to talking about how many people are going on the bus to the airport bam and and they went in and and I caught up with David a number of years later I had a FBI pres I had a presidential intern from the White House internal with me in the bureau we're drinking in a bar with David Van Ness I got a lot of stories where I'm drinking at a bar with somebody and the intern walked around everybody and tapped David on the shoulder and he says uh Chris says you kept the Terrorist on the phone up to the moment that the SAS came in the door and David says yeah and I already kept him on the phone even longer if the SAS had hadn't come in so soon so why am I telling that story if you're going to get into that line of business you got to accept all the things that go with it and realize that it's not you that made the decision somebody else did you got to implement the strategy you remember a case uh in Sacramento",

                "transcript": "you remember a case uh in Sacramento where I think it was a youth gang took over like an electronic store good guy Siege yeah I remember this when I was a kid there are two things that that stand out in my mind from when I was a kid one was the um Good Guys was the name of the electronic store right good guys with electronic store and uh bad guys uh so to speak went in there took them hostage and um I must have been a kid this must have been like late it was a late 80s 80s or something like that um I remember that case um 89 or 90. I I knew one of the negotiators that was 15. so I was born in 75 so um and as I recall they ended up opening fire on a bunch of hostages who were laying down on the ground is that right they um they they knew that they were getting ready to execute the hostages because they put bags over their heads and that whenever the bad guys do anything to dehumanize a hostage it's easier to shoot somebody with a bag over their head than it is not because you can't see their face and so the bad guys had begun that process and they knew they needed to assault God forbid anyone should ever be taken hostage I realize circumstances differ but you just mentioned putting bags over their heads there's this notion of sheeple that you know people will describe um post-hoc after something about how you know somebody walks into a building tells people to you know put zip ties on their own ankles or go into a back room that nobody resists and that in retrospect had somebody caused a commotion they might have caused enough of a commotion to either run out or be let go um and yet of course there's a very logical part of everybody's brain I would hope that thinks listen this person is an aggressor there's a gun in my face don't be an idiot right because we also have heard of the case in New York City that I read about this in the newspaper so presumably it's true where someone was held up at gunpoint and one of the women in the group that was held up said what are you gonna do shoot us and the person shot them right so that happens too so you know um I don't know if there's a a fair and safe answer to give people on this but if you're told to do something by somebody and it's all happening in real time I mean you have to ask do they want my money in my body my life or some combination of the three right in real time while under presumably significant duress um but for hostages like if they if they disobey cause a commotion is that extending their life or is it shortening their life I guess it it's very context dependent right um the only thing that I could without knowing the context anything you could do to humanize yourself and comply with what the bad guys want increases your chance of survival so let's say you got ordered to go in a back room you could look at the hostage taker and say I'll do whatever you say I'm Chris you know drop your name on them in a way so that you go from being a faceless person to somebody with a name that increases the chances of your survival humanization whatever you can do to comply simultaneously become more of a human being because it's the opposite of what I was talking about before if you're easier to kill if you've been dehumanized you're harder to kill if you've been humanized you're harder to harm like maybe they're not going to kill you they're just gonna they're just gonna hurt you they're less likely to harm you if they know your first name how do you get them as a hostage negotiator if they if they talk about a hostage I'll say you you know you mean you mean Sheila do you mean Rex you know I'll find a way to drop the person's name into the conversation so as soon as if if you can humanize just by getting them to know your name you increase the chances of survivability you increase the chances of being treated better and and comply I'll do whatever well I'll do whatever you say I'm Chris is gonna is gonna start to move the odds in your favor you know that what you just described extends to uh science um you know I've talked before about my stance on animal research and um why I choose to no longer do it um I do think it has its place in making important discoveries that cannot be made on humans but that eventually extend to oh you don't want to do it I don't want to do it personally I don't want to do it and I don't want to do primate work or large carnivore work or small carnivore work but um the point I was going to make is that when you do primate work um they strongly discourage near forbid you from giving them names right they give them numbers right right right right right so it all falls in line with what you were what you were talking about because the moment something has a name it moves from being a research animal to a pet of sorts and that makes it a relationship right so interesting how a name turns something from a you know it elevates something to a relationship however insignificant it it's up a notch an entire empathy circuitry yeah yeah yeah which is uh perhaps the appropriate segue to talk about empathy this is a topic that uh you spend a lot of times you uh you mentioned tactical empathy right documentary by the way when is that going to be out or do we have some sense my guess is uh we'll finish jumping through all the hoops and probably have out at the beginning of next year we're um I'm currently working with William Morris Endeavor on a couple of different projects they've been enormously supportive and we've asked for their guidance on uh how to how to the best time to get the documentary out and very happy with the people I'm dealing with there and actually stroke of the universe was looking out for me funny set of circumstances and just really enjoy with the people that I'm working with there so probably first part of next year fantastic what's your take on empathy I think of",

                "transcript": "what's your take on empathy I think of empathy in the pop culture sense of you know somebody's feeling pain and we feel their pain but of course empathy extends way beyond that yeah yeah yeah and that was um uh Rob malenka yeah my colleague at Stanford yeah I was I was really fascinated by the conversation that you you had with him on that recently and so and he said a lot of people use empathy a lot of different ways sort of for their own meanings so um my take on empathy tactical empathy also to keep drawing names out because people give me thoughts and I want to Source them out I'm very close to Stephen Cutler's perspective on it and Stephen would say empathy is about the transmission of information compassion is the reaction to the transmission I like that and by the way I'm a fan of Steven's work I think he I think he's quite astute and a boy is he a hard worker he writes like a beast I think he's up at like four in the morning he also has like 50 Chihuahuas or something crazy he's weighing the dogs yeah yeah well you can fit more Chihuahuas in a room than any others gotcha Steven but yeah so um and and that was when I was with the FBI we started collaborating with Harvard because the Harvard definition um was empathy was not liking the other side it was just demonstrating an understanding of their perspective um Bob manukin's book beyond winnings chapter the tension between empathy and assertiveness he says empathy is not agreeing disagreeing or even liking the other side which sort of falls into what Stephen talked about you know it's about the transmission of information now empathy is very compassionate thing to do but it doesn't necessarily equate to compassion itself if I'm if I do if I let you know if I make you feel heard by me saying to you what your perspective on something is you're going to feel cared for you're going to feel understood it's going to land with you really well I don't necessarily have to feel compassion for you I know it's a precursor to compassion so I would separate it from sympathy clearly and I would even separate it from compassion although I know it's a very compassionate thing to do it's about tactical empathy is about me actively demonstrating verbally to you that I understand where you're coming from tactic from The Experience on hostage negotiators backed up by Neuroscience is that people largely react negatively so the smarter move for me instead of trying to reinforce a positive is to First deactivate the negative by simply calling it out calling the elephant a room out don't deny the elephant don't ignore the elephant call The Elephant a room out say it probably going to sound like I'm greedy if I expect that you're going to think I'm overreaching I'm not going to say I don't want you to think I'm greedy I'm going to say it's probably going to seem greedy so simply well-educated emotional intelligence influence gut instinct influence on what the other side is thinking and feeling if I can Define it in that way then it becomes an unlimited skill if it requires me for to have compassion for you when I don't then that limits my ability to use empathy and I'm not interested in having that ability to be limited I want it to be an unlimited skill so if you just if you just Define it strictly in terms of transmission of information then it's not sympathy or Compassion or liking or green it has a very powerful effect it at least feels like compassion to the other side it reacts with the emotional circuitry the neurochemicals that everybody has to some degree if they're alive even if they're on this the spectrum they have some of that going on inside and of what I've read on even even a mental illnesses uh in my last century training I saw people who were paranoid schizophrenic is it effectively be more of a wiring problem than a chemical problem for for Layman's description and a lot of what I've read said empathy's even effective with paranoid schizophrenics people regardless of how uh disarray the circuitry in their head is it's uh it helps them on some level to feel understood so empathy is just about letting somebody feel understood example when I'm working terrorism we had a lot of Arab Muslims testify an open civilian court against a legitimate Muslim cleric who was also a criminal who also committed crimes and I would sit down with them and I'd say to him right off the bat because I know where they're coming from you believe that there's been a succession of American governments for the last 200 years that have been anti-islamic and they'd look at me and they go like yeah I never said I it was true I never said I agreed I never said I disagreed by me simply articulating what their perspective on the interaction was they were so startled by it was empathy and and we were so good at that empathy frequently in that in that time frame they would say are you are you Muslim and I'd say no I respect the religion you know if you need to know you know I'm a Christian but I respect your religion and I I got no problem saying to you where you're coming from that's empathy from my definition and then it becomes an unlimited skill I don't have to feel it I don't have to necessarily want to do anything about it you know Goldman says there's cognitive empathy me just recognizing where your emotions are coming from there's emotional empathy me feeling your emotions and there's empathic concern me wanting to do something about your distress my version of tactical empathy probably brings those into play in sequence on a Continuum of sorts but none of them are precursors it's just me showing to you that I understand where you're coming from and it has a phenomenally favorable impact on the interaction tell me about mirroring as a tool yeah",

                "transcript": "tell me about mirroring as a tool yeah mirroring is a one of the simplest easiest and most effective of the skill set takes the least amount of brain power it's just repeating one to three-ish words of what somebody's just said uh can be one it should never usually be more than five hostage negotiators learn it by repeating the last one to three words that somebody's just said it doesn't have to be the last one to three words and the mirroring is not the body language mirror it's not mimicking anybody physically and it's not mimicking their tone of voice or their affect or anything about them it's just repeating one to three-ish words we found that accesses for whatever part of brain you uh that you got to energize to do it it's it's a different part of the brain than labeling people are usually either good really good at labeling like I label almost everybody on my team labels a lot sounds like this is bothering you sounds like seems like you're just not really sure where this is going and the the mirror I gotta consciously make it a point to mirror and what's a mirror used for it's in place of what did you mean by that or would you please go on or I don't understand could you repeat that again so I'll listen for stuff that either I don't understand or I need you to talk more about and instead of saying could you say some more about that I'll just mirror the words now for whatever reason it connects the thoughts in your head the message the way that lands is I heard what you said the words I got the words because I just repeated them and I still don't understand so I need a more in-depth explanation without using the same words that you just used because if you say um I think I suppress actualism is is useless and I might say what do you mean by that and you go isopractorism is useless you repeat the same words only louder you figure that saying a ladder will make it penetrate my cranium that doesn't work I need you to read to explain to go into more depth to expand using different words and for whatever reason we found as hostage negotiators that I find in business that if I mirror you you'll expand and you'll connect so it's I use it in that context I might use it to get you to hear yourself out loud like if what you just said doesn't make sense I'll repeat it backward for word one to three words and I'll upward inflect I'll say that that doesn't make sense you know use use my tone make it land with my tone so you can hear yourself out loud somebody else just pointed out to me the other day that if you're talking to somebody and they're in mid thought and they kind of their voice Trails off because they sort of lost their train of thought if you mirror them there that helps them get their train of thought back and expand so it's it's a ridiculously effective communication tool to get people to expand and feel heard its Simplicity puts some people off there are some people that say yeah it sounds stupid I don't see what good that will do I always notice if somebody's really wants to know about mirroring my description is they're both high IQ and high EQ and why does that work a high IQ guy is going to want to know something that's really simple that doesn't take any effort to do and that's what a mirror does it's really really effective it's almost no effort on your part at all interesting I must say that Neuroscience has a um an unfortunate dearth of knowledge about how brains interact this is starting to change but most of what we know about how brains work is from putting people into functional magnetic resonance imaging machine so-called MRI exposing them to movies or games that they have to play Etc and then looking at brain state activation there are a few Laboratories starting to look at how people interact in real time with both people in separate MRI machines that hopefully will be able to parse some of this and I'm certain that somebody hearing this will use this knowledge to go do the experiment if not I'll I'll run out the flagpole to some uh highly qualified people at Stanford who could who could do this because it'd be fun to see what's happening but I have the sense that what's happening is that there is a real merge of cognition when one hears their own words right spoken back to them that um well it's you know you've now got two brains processing the same information and that has to lead new places so um I don't have any um insight as to where what exactly is happening but um certainly that something is happening there right right evidenced by the real world results that you're getting we don't need experiments to tell us that um but it'd be interesting to to see and learn a bit of what's happening if there's a fusion for instance of a co-activation of emotional centers co-activation of there's something about hearing our own voice is very different than hearing other people's voices most people cringe when they hear their own voice on recording right um most not all um some people are in love with their own voice um we know these people but we know that our auditory system cancels out the hearing of our own voice did you know that as we're talking now our auditory system is suppressing our own voice we don't really hear ourselves speak the same way that when you speak I hear you speak yeah so um it's an active neurochemical inhibition of the response and it's amazing too because as we grow up our voice changes puberty and so forth and other ways too that the vocal cords change in thickness Etc and our voice changes but we always know self from other in terms of voice and we cancel out our actual auditory perception of our own that's fascinating and breathing and heartbeat we shut down our response to self actively within the brain that's fascinating so maybe hearing back some of what we just said allows us to actually hear what we just said yeah well true and that's why people sometimes all somebody needs is a sounding board so they can they can somebody else can hear hear they can hear themselves out and get repeated back to them and then they go like wait a minute did I just say that yeah interesting interesting useful indeed",

                "transcript": "indeed proactive listening tell us about proactive listening we're all told that we need to be better listeners you know the other day someone said we got two ears in one mouth as if that's supposed to remind us um most people have two ears in one mouth um but I get the point they were saying hey there's value in listening and more often than not we default to broadcast but no reception we're mostly broadcast less reception right um hence the uh the call for nasal breathing it's useful in a lot of circumstances uh because it keeps us it keeps our mouth shut um what is proactive listening how do we do it what's it good for I'm really trying to get people out of the notion of active listening just because active listening has been so overused the people have lost track of it and most of it is taught poorly and it's interactive versus proactive and so we learned as hostage negotiators first of all just to label the presenting emotion and we just assume that and the presenting emotion was always anger of some form anger upset on certain rare instances the guy was under control but they were almost always negative emotions so we just assumed that it was uh defined to what was uh confined to what was driving hostage takers was negativity now if I may because now I feel like an imposter talking about Neuroscience to you your knowledge of Neuroscience is is spot on uh Voss I I'm gonna say numerous times you've asked me about things in neuroscience and you've never been off the mark so yeah you've clearly done your homework too oh so we keep trying to learn about it but um Layman's terminology the survival brain is largely negative ballpark I would say 75 negative your reactions are going to be negative so number one I believe that's principally backed up by the experiments of Neuroscience the fmri have used alluded to and so then in hostage negotiation we were taught to basically label the presenting emotion and then I've seen experimentation or reporting of experiments um I think that first time I read about it was in a book called The upward spiral and that book is a good 10 years old I think which means you know the Neuroscience is evolving but primarily the experiment there that I remember reading about and read about in other places that if people were undergoing a negative emotion in my Layman's paraphrase of the experiment is they've shown a picture that induced the negative emotion in their head and then they asked people to Simply call out what the emotion was and when they self-labeled then the emotion diminished now the degree of diminishment varies but the percentage of time that it diminishes by simply by calling it out is just darn near all the time so for largely 75 percent negative and we can deactivate the negativity by calling it out well let's be proactive if you're a human being and we're engaged in a negotiation there's going to be certain very predictable negativity that's going to be there and I should be proactive in calling it out anticipating the negativity is going to be there based on a circumstances highly predictable and your gut instinct before you're referring to when you want to say look I don't want you to think I'm being greedy your gut's telling you it's highly predictable you're going to come off as greedy so let me be proactive and say it's probably going to seem like I'm being greedy and that's the dialing over to what is eminently predictable in the interaction and just being proactive to deactivate the negative emotions that either are taking place or what our experiences found then I haven't seen any science that is yet that has had the opportunity to back this up it inoculates I can create a barrier if I call out a negative that's not there it doesn't plant it it actually inoculates you from it if and I've done this in practice I've I was given a lecture a couple of years ago anybody asked a question I try to find the value in the question no matter how bad the question is this poor guy asked me a question that I just cannot find a single component in his question that demonstrates that he was listening or paying attention there was nothing about it that I could congratulate him on and so I said this is going to sound harsh because I know the answer I'm getting ready to give him is going to make it sound like to the group that I think he's stupid I just I can't think of a way to respond to this without saying effectively like what are you thinking about that's got nothing to do what we're talking about so I go this is going to sound harsh and I answer the question and he just kind of goes okay and I start answering somebody else question and he goes that wasn't harsh now if I hadn't said this is going to sound harsh and answered the question I guarantee you my answer would have embarrassed them and embarrassment is one of the worst negative emotions you can inflict on anybody and he would hate me to this day for embarrassing him so I got a moment coming at me that is predictably negative and I can let it I can let that train run me down or I can call that out in advance and get a reaction where the guy says it wasn't that bad and that's what being proactive about the emotions is about I love it and I'm recalling an instance during graduate school where my graduate advisor who sadly has passed away but was a phenomenal scientist I mean just so pure insisted on getting the answers could emotionally detach from the answers and she's just was it was a ninja she used to come into the laboratory when we were working on a paper and she'd sit down and she'd say You're Gonna Hate Me for what I'm about to ask you to do and I think oh no like I'm gonna have to redo all the analysis or I'm gonna like some you know Monumental thing and then she'd say you gotta change the like fonts in figure two like oh my Godly what do you mean I want to hate you but but it was relief but I wanted nothing more than to make her happy with my work because I I respected the standard that she held so so greatly um I mean she could have asked me to you know stand on my head and do the experiments 50 times I would probably would have done it if I thought they would make the project better and as a consequence she would have been pleased um because she was the standard for me in many ways still is but I'm wondering if she read your book because uh she's depressed these um requests with like you're gonna hate me and then she'd ask me for something like oh I hate you like that's nothing but now I wonder if if I would have been taken aback if she had just said uh you know um hey by the way figure two needs redoing I might have been kind of bristled by that so um maybe she read your book Chris these are great tools mirroring and proactive listening and thank you for sharing these of course did you ever employ the family members",

                "transcript": "did you ever employ the family members of kidnappers friends of kidnappers as a means to kind of um tap into a different aspect of their psyche you know because I think that we are all as human beings very context driven so I can imagine that the person who kidnapped somebody or who's um trying to steal somebody's resources is in a particular groove of the of person and and I I do think there are people in the world who are just evil but I also know because I've read about it and I trust the sources that there are people who have done horrendous things who love their dog um and genuinely love their dog and wouldn't harm an animal but I'm not trying to give these people a pass but I could imagine that um those other facets to somebody represent really good entry points for allowing them to see the kind of incongruence in their behavior um or is it the case that when these are high stress situations that you just have to basically you know you have to attack the you know disarm the aggressor and you're just focusing on the person as the bad actor not considering the other contexts of their lives all right so let's draw a distinction between uh hostage takers in a contained situation and um kidnappers uncontained unknown location so you're probably asking about somebody in a contained situation uh bad guys in a bank Dwight Watson in in his tractor in Washington DC so very counterintuitively if they're in a contained situation there's a saying out there that says A system that you're employing is perfectly designed to give you the outcome that you have so bad guy Dwight Watson is on his tractor in DC the family's part of the system to put them there the blunt harsh reality of that is now at that siege that went on long enough and it was so high profile some of his family members showed up now we can we could and and did try to use them I'm walking I'm walking from one place to another from the negotiation operation uh cell component on the way to command post hostage negotiator stops me a couple of people with them it's Watson's family and they see I'm in a hurry and that I'm not interested in being stopped and they got to say to me something to stop me and get my um attention and they go look our brother's just hurting in his heart he's just hurting you know things have gone bad for our whole family and he's just hurt in his heart don't kill him over that and I looked at the negotiator and I said get that on tape and we'll play that for him because if we can get that on tape exactly the way they said it that'll land but if we put them on the phone with them they're going to try to reason with them and they're going to say stuff to them they didn't help which they don't very well intention but it's going to be counterintuitive and it's probably going to make it worse so you have to understand family can be extremely important if you can get them to say exactly the right thing and it's probably going to need to be highly orchestrated because you know how it's going to land and unfortunately if you get them in a direct conversation it'll probably renew an old wound you know family members have hurt each other in ways that they have no idea even happened and so the other you know a family member my son to this day remembers when I told him Santa Claus wasn't real and I have no what I have no memory of that conversation I'm sorry I blew it for you right man wait we got oh my goodness the family members have heard each other over the years that they have no idea which comes up in these live conversations and you don't know what what wounds you don't even know what wounds are there that you caused and so in in a contained situation a family member can be extremely helpful but it has to be it's it's a surgical shot that you have to be really really really careful with otherwise it can go the other way because the wounds and people don't even know are there such a psychologically astute way of viewing it because I'm a big fan of the so-called family systems model of psychology I mean you can't look at any human being psychology positive meaning adaptive or maladaptive psychology and not look at the family system which that evolved which is not to say that some perfectly healthy families occasionally don't have issues with a child having mental illness and and I mean that happens but I'm told that 99.9 of the time you can identify a family system organization or a lineage a genetic tie Etc that that makes things start to make sense when somebody's really struggling right right and and as you pointed out sadly oftentimes that that involves um Pains of past um wow well thanks for sharing that because I I think that um in my mind the movie version of it is you know they bring the mother in and it's like Billy don't do it you know and then as you said Billy might like that might be the time when Billy's really gonna let his mother know you know her childhood sucked for Billy right and that's not what you want yeah goodness what a complex job what a",

people now helping people help people um providing a lot of service in the world through a lot of different channels um first of all I want to say that your book never split the difference one of my favorite books thank you um I don't say that lightly I don't endorse books very often but the books I do endorse I love love love I also have to say that it's a toss-up between your book never split the disc difference and the body keeps the score for the award for best titles of any book those are just like amazing titles amazing amazing titles Paul Ross or uh co-writer came up with the title yeah it's a phenomenal title that in the body keep this keeps the score just like because there's so much contained in in the title and then the book um exceeds expectations so uh really amazing book people should listen to it read it if they haven't already but you're doing a lot more right now than um than just writing although I want to hear about your other book projects as well but before you list off the number of things you're doing tell me first about Fireside because this sounds like a really interesting um Endeavor that frankly I haven't heard of before what's Fireside a brand new social media platform it's essentially an interactive podcast it's a subscription service founded by Fallon fatimi and Mark Cuban follow and I have been friends for a number of years she was Google's youngest employee she's an entrepreneur Dynamic smart hard charging person and it's sort of grew out of what's inadequate in some of the social media apps that are out there trying to combine the best ideas of a few different things and found suggested it to me and I thought I'll jump in because she's a visionary and what has turned out to be is it's effectively weekly Interactive Group coaching and you you get the app off your iPhone or your Android whatever platform your phone is on and then you log in we do an hour once a week and it's you're getting group coaching and then you get asked questions and it's got a video component to it so if you want to ask a question we we're going to bring you up on quote stage and I get to see you and talk directly to you and you get to see me and talk directly to me or and I interviewed Mark Cuban a couple of weeks ago and people got to come on and ask Mark questions or ask me questions and what it has turned out to be is just one of sort of uh uh the the next level of how to get better at negotiations after you've read the book and probably taken to Master Class you know where do you go next one of the people that came on the podcast the other day the the Fireside episode they said well I don't have enough money yet to go to your in-person training events because those are expensive and this is how I'm going to get better in the in a meantime and and work my way in that direction and so the monthly coaching if you were to sign up for group coaching from us on a regular basis on a monthly basis it would probably easily cost you for what we're providing twenty five thirty thousand dollars a month and this is a thousand a year so at scale it's an opportunity to interact directly with me and the members on my team once a week and get group coaching and it's and it's just kind of fun we're getting a kick out of it and people that really really care about interacting well with people guy comes on the first episode I did and he said besides the fact that you helped me make a lot more money you helped me save my marriage and he just needed to know how to talk more genuinely and honestly with his wife in a way that made her felt heard and he didn't really have a good way to do that beforehand and I was just like that's a lot I don't I don't I don't know how to respond to that other than just be grateful that people can say stuff like that to us so the Fireside thing is kind of cool we're still experimenting with it it's an interactive podcast group coaching it's fun great I mean I would say uh you're changing lives there I mean the saving a marriage is no small deal and I think that the ability to communicate um directly with people also I imagine gives them the opportunity to implement the the tools that you're providing in real time and that's one thing to hear about something and and try it but then uh you can give feedback in real time are you on these these Fireside Chats directly or members of your team no I I do we do one every week and I'm once a month and the other thing too like I can explain something one way and if for whatever reason it doesn't land in your context you can't quite get it so that's what we found about the interactive nature of it somebody comes on and asks a question in their context and then I'll answer it and then they'll go like oh oh oh oh okay all right that helped so you get you get to hear people like you who are struggling with it the way you are but I haven't put it in your context yet and that's the other thing that's great about a q a live q a we had a guest on here who told me that there are amazing data supporting the fact that people follow the medical and health advice of doctors that they can relate to far more than they follow the medical and health advice of the Physicians that they feel aren't like them um and oftentimes this can include the physician or health care provider being someone that they would aspire to be like but oftentimes it's just some common Rapport like they both like baseball or they both like to cook or to garden and that sets a bridge right where then the patient is willing to do all these things that ordinarily they would be resistant to right and and there are really good data to support this and I I that that really stuck with me because it says that it's it's not just about the information or the the delivery route or the information that the context and the rapports even along something is like oh you you're uh by the way I'm not a major you know a major sports fan on most things but you know like oh you're a Bills fan or something like me too like that can be the difference between somebody doing all the things to lower their blood pressure or the day in changing their diet all the all those things versus not making the changes at all Rapport is the magic yeah it's kind of a magic component that changes changes everything well Fireside sounds like a great opportunity for people to not just ask questions but to build rapport with you and members of your team so um I'm gonna check it out Lord knows I uh I need help improving my communications and certain domains of life believe me I get the memos um fact um what other writing projects are you involved in if any um we're we've been toying it with this uh companion uh operations manual for tactical empathy which getting it right is important so it's sort of a companion book to never spit the difference that's probably at least a year and a half out from being done so in the meantime we just do we do a lot of online training you know we got a we got a newsletter we put out weekly for for people to get our latest Cutting Edge application thoughts as much as possible we're putting information out that we charge for a lot and we put out a lot of free stuff you know I'm I I'm throwing out ideas on Instagram but we're constantly trying to put information out there so that so that people can collaborate better so specific we just finished a book for residential real estate agents a friend of mine Steve Shull we put that out last November that's sort of niched but it's mostly the Black Swan method for real estate agents because every conversation they're in is a difficult emotional conversation sell of a house is one of the most stressful moments of anybody's life selling or buying so we just put that out in the meantime you know we're spreading gospel as much as possible well we'll certainly point out the various places people can find you and and the different venues for for learning more I want to say that",

                "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is ExpressVPN. ExpressVPN is a virtual private network that keeps your data secure by routing your data and online activities through their servers and keeping your data safe and secure but also not selling your data to third parties. I started using ExpressVPN because unfortunately I had my bank accounts hacked. I was traveling a lot and I typically go on hotel or airline or other public Wi-Fi from time to time and I don't know how it happened, but somehow my information got out there, and as I learned more from my friends and people that work in the tech community, it turns out that many networks are not secure, so with ExpressVPN, it keeps all your information secure. It keeps information about your passwords secure. It keeps information about the websites that you visit secure, and as I mentioned earlier, they never give away or sell your data. The nice thing is you can use ExpressVPN, it runs in the background and you don't even really realize that it's on. It works on your phone, it works on your laptop, it even works on your smart TV. If you'd like to try ExpressVPN, you can go to expressvpn.com/huberman to get three months free on their one-year program. I love ExpressVPN. I use it even when I'm at home, and so if you want to try it, you can go to expressvpn.com/huberman and you'll get three months free on their one-year program. The second sponsor of today's podcast is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I started taking Athletic Greens in 2012 because I wanted to cover my vitamin and mineral bases. I didn't know which things to take. I found it really dizzying to know which vitamins and minerals to purchase and Athletic Greens allowed me to get all the things I needed to cover my bases in one easy to consume formula that also happens to taste really good. I mix mine with water and a little bit of lemon juice. The probiotics in Athletic Greens are also really important to me because now there's an abundance of data showing that the gut microbiome, which is supported by probiotics, is important for gut-brain axis, mood, metabolic function, hormone function, just a huge number of biological functions and health parameters. If you want to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, and if you do that, they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3 K2. Vitamin D3 also has lot of support from the scientific literature showing that it's important for immune function, so if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, you'll get Athletic Greens plus the year's supply of vitamin D3 K2 and they'll give you five free travel packets. Mixing up powders is a little bit messy sometimes when you're on the road, if you're in the car, you're on the plane or you're on the move. These travel packets make everything really clean and really easy. Once again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman for Athletic Greens, the five free travel packets, and the year's supply of vitamin D3 K2. Many of you have graciously asked how you can help support the Huberman Lab Podcast. There are several ways that you can do that. One is to check out our sponsors, the other is we've set up a Patreon account. You can go to patreon.com/andrewhuberman and that allows you to donate to the podcast at a variety of different levels. In addition, if you could subscribe to the podcast on YouTube, that's terrific. If you haven't done that already, please do so, and please leave a comment. If you want to make suggestions about future episodes, please also put that in the comment section. If you subscribe on Apple or Spotify or both, that helps us, and as well, Apple gives you the opportunity to leave a review and give us a five star rating if you feel we deserve a five star rating, and of course, please recommend the podcast to your friends, to your family members, anyone that you think would benefit from the information. Really, the answer to your question of how you can support the podcast is you don't have to buy products, although checking out the sponsors does help. You don't have to donate to Patreon. We, of course, can't require you to subscribe and fill out reviews and things of that sort, but we like to think that by providing a number of different ways to support the podcast, some of which are zero cost, some of which, if you like, gives you the opportunity to contribute financially, that's terrific as well. Thank you so much. We really appreciate your interest in helping us keep this coming your way. Thank you.",

                "transcript": "Thank you. Let's continue our discussion about neuroplasticity. This incredible feature of our nervous system that allows it to change itself in response to experience, and even in ways that we consciously and deliberately decide to change it. That's an incredible feature. No other organ in our body has that capability. Our nervous system, which governs everything about who we are, how we feel and what we do, does have that capability. The issue is most people don't know how to access neuroplasticity. Children readily access neuroplasticity and they don't even realize that they're doing it. Adults want neuroplasticity and so that's what this entire month of the Huberman Lab Podcast has been about. We've explored neuroplasticity from a variety of different perspectives. We talked about representational plasticity. We talked about the importance of focus and reward. We talked about this amazing and somewhat surprising aspect of the vestibular system, how altering our relationship to gravity, and in addition to that, making errors as we try and learn, can open up windows to plasticity, but we have not really talked so much about directing the plasticity toward particular outcomes, and thus far, we really haven't talked yet about how to undo things that we don't want. I've talked about learning and I say learn a language, learn free throws, learn a particular motor skill, et cetera, but what about what we would call unlearning or about removing some aspect of our experience that we don't want? And so today, we are going to explore that aspect of neuroplasticity and we are going to do that in the context of a very important and somewhat sensitive topic which is pain regeneration,",

For those of you that are fortunate enough to not have or had a concussion or not have or know someone who is experiencing chronic or acute pain, I encourage you to stay in here with us because a lot of the information that we are going to cover has direct relevance to neuroplasticity for other purposes. We, as always here on this podcast, are going to discuss some of the science, we get into mechanism, but we also really get at principles. Principles are far more important than any one experiment or one description of mechanism and certainly far more important than any one protocol because principles allow you to think about your nervous system and work with it in ways that best serve you. They are very flexible batches of information. We are going to talk about the principles of neuroplasticity for removing pain and wound healing and injury. We're going to talk about acupuncture, of all things. We are going to talk about modern medicine's attempt to try and restore youth to the aging or injured or demented brain, and we are going to definitely talk about tools. Got a lot of tools. I consulted a number of fantastic colleagues at Stanford, at Harvard Medical School, and in the greater community of tissue rehabilitation, injury and pain management in preparation for this podcast. I do want to be very clear and just remind you that I'm not a medical doctor. I'm a professor, so I don't prescribe anything. I profess things. I have my beliefs, but the podcast is for information purposes. I do hope that the tools that we discuss will be of benefit to you, but as always, you should talk to your doctor or healthcare provider about any tools that you plan to add or are looking to explore, as well as anything that you might look to remove from your daily protocols. In other words, don't change anything without consulting an expert first. You are responsible for your health, not me, and I say this not just to protect me but also to protect you. Please keep that in mind as we move forward and I'm very excited to share with you this information because I do feel that it can be of great benefit to a number of people. Let's start our discussion about pain and sensation and regeneration and wound healing with a discussion about a very important system in the nervous system, which is the somatosensory system.",

                "transcript": "which is the somatosensory system. The somatosensory system is, as the name implies, involved in understanding touch, physical feeling on our body, and the simplest way to think about the somatosensory system is that we have little sensors and those sensors come in the form of neurons, nerve cells, that reside in our skin and in the deeper layers below the skin, and indeed, we do. We have some that correspond to, and we should say respond to, mechanical touch, so pressure on the top of my hand or a pinpoint, or other sensors, for instance, respond to heat, to cold. Some respond to vibration. We have a huge number of different receptors in our skin and they take that information and send it down these wires that we call axons in the form of electrical signals to our spinal cord and then up to the brain, and within the spinal cord and brain, we have centers that interpret that information, that actually make sense of those electrical signals, and this is amazing because none of those sensors has a different unique form of information that it uses. It just sends electrical potentials into the nervous system. The nervous system, you somehow decode what a given stimulus on your skin is. Maybe it's the wind blowing gently and deflecting some of the hairs on your arm or maybe it's a sharp pinprick or a hot stove or the warmth of a glowing fire. That all arrives in your nervous system in the form of these electrical things we call action potentials, which is just amazing, and then the brain computes them and make sense of them. We have peripheral sensors and we've got stations up in our brain and within our spinal cord that make sense of all the stuff coming in. Pain and the sensation of pain is, believe it or not, a controversial word in the neuroscience field. People prefer to use the word nociception. Nociceptors are the sensors in the skin that detect particular types of stimuli. It actually comes from the Latin word nocere which means to harm, and why would neuroscientists not want to talk about pain? Well, it's very subjective. It has a mental component and a physical component. We cannot say that pain is simply an attempt to avoid physical harm to the body,",

                "transcript": "to avoid physical harm to the body, and here's why. They actually can be dissociated from one another. A good example would be if, God forbid, you were exposed to high levels of radiation, such as working with some sort of material that was radioactive or you were near a former radioactive plant or some some radiation, excessive X-rays, et cetera, you wouldn't feel any pain during the X-rays. In fact, you don't. If you've ever had X-rays, as I have, you don't feel anything. They put you under that lead blanket, they run behind a wall and then they, in my case, then they take these pictures of your teeth and it's really scary because you go, \"Something really terrible must be happening here,\" but you don't feel anything, but there can be a lot of tissue damage. There can be mutations introduced to cells, et cetera. I've had X-rays, I'm not saying people shouldn't have X-rays, but excessive X-rays certainly are not good for human beings, likewise with excessive exposure to any radiation. There can be tissue damage without the physical perception or mental perception of pain at all. As well, there can be the belief of pain or the feeling of pain without there being tissue damage, and there's a famous case that was published in the \"British Journal of Medicine\" where a construction worker, I think he fell is how the story went, and a 14-inch nail went through his boot and up through the boot and he was in excruciating pain just beyond anything he'd experienced. He reported that he couldn't even move in any dimension, even a tiny bit, without feeling excruciating pain. They brought him into the clinic, into the hospital, they were able to cut away the boot and they realized that the nail had gone between two toes and it had actually not impaled the skin at all. His visual image of the nail going through his boot gave him the feeling, the legitimate feeling, that he was experiencing the pain of a nail going through his foot, which is incredible because it speaks to the power of the mind in this pain scenario and it also speaks to the power of the specificity. It's not like he thought that his foot was on fire. He thought, because he saw a nail going through his foot, well, it was going through his boot, but he thought it was going through his foot, that it was sharp pain of the sort that a nail would produce, and there are thousands of these kinds of case reports out there. That is not to say that all pain that we experience is in our head, but it really speaks to the incredible capacity that these top-down, these higher-level cognitive functions have in interpreting what we're experiencing out in the periphery, even just on the basis of what we see, and the example of radiation speaks to the fact that pain and tissue damage are dissociable from one another. Why are we talking about pain during a month on neuroplasticity? Well, it turns out that the pain system offers us a number of different principles that we can leverage to, A, ensure that if we are ever injured, we are able to understand the difference between injury and pain because there is a difference, that if we're ever in pain, that we can understand the difference between injury and pain, that we will be able to interpret our pain, and during the course of today's podcast, I'm going to cover protocols that help eliminate pain from both ends of the spectrum, from the periphery, at the level of the injury, and through these top-down mental mechanisms. A lot of times on this podcast, in fact mostly, I tend to center on the physiology,",

A sodium channel is one of these little holes in neurons that allows them to fire action potentials. It's important to the function of the neuron. It's also important for the development of certain neurons, and there's a particular mutation, there are kids that are born without this sodium channel 1.7, if you want to look it up. Those kids experience no pain, no pain whatsoever, and it is a terrible situation. They burn themselves. They tend to rest on their limbs too long. They don't make the microadjustments. You might see me swiveling around in my chair, moving around a lot. Those microadjustments are actually normal, healthy microadjustments that prevent us from going into pain. They don't make those adjustments. They don't get the feedback that they're in a particular position and so they never make those adjustments and their joints get destroyed, essentially. They don't tend to live very long due to accidents. It's a really terrible and unfortunate circumstance. Some people have a mutation in the same channel where they make too much of this channel so they feel too much pain. In fact, it's reasonable to speculate that one of the reasons, not all, but one of the reasons why people might differ in their sensitivity to pain is by way of genetic variation in how many of these sorts of receptors that they express. People who make too much of this receptor experience extreme pain from even subtle stimuli. The good news is there are good drug treatments that can block specifically this sodium channel 1.7 and so those people get a lot of relief from taking such drugs. Pain and how much pain we are sensitive to or insensitive to probably has some genetic basis, and then of course, there are things that we can do to make sure that we experience less pain, although pain has this adaptive role.

Your back is an enormous piece of tissue compared to your fingertip, but your back has fewer receptors devoted to it and the representation of your back in your brain is actually pretty small, whereas the representation of your finger is enormous. How big a brain area is devoted to a given body part is directly related to the density of receptors in that body part, not the size of the body part, and that's why if we were to draw your homunculus or Costello's dogunculus, what we would find is that certain areas, like the lips, like the fingertips, like the genitalia, like the eyes and the area around the face, would have a huge representation, whereas the back, the torso, and areas of the body that are less sensitive are going to have smaller representations. It'd be a very distorted map. You can actually know how sensitive a given body part is and how much brain area is devoted to it through what's called two-point discrimination. You can do this experiment if you want. I think I've described this once or twice before, but basically if you have someone put, maybe take two pens and put them maybe six inches apart on your back and touch while you're facing away and they'll ask you how many points they're touching you and you say two, but if they move those closer together, say three inches, you're likely to experience it as one point of contact, whereas on your finger, you could play that game all day and as long as there's a millimeter or so spacing, you will know that it's two points as opposed to one and that's because there's more pixels, more density of receptors. This has direct bearing to pain because it says that areas of the body that have denser receptors are going to be more sensitive to pain than to others, and where we have more receptors, we tend to have more blood vessels and glia, which are the support cells, and other cells that lend to the inflammation response and that's really important. Just as a rule of thumb, areas of your body that are injured that are large areas that have low sensitivity before injury likely are going to experience less pain and the literature shows will heal more slowly because they don't have as many cells around to produce inflammation,",

The sensation is that the limb is experiencing pain or is contorted in the specific orientation that it was around the time of the injury. If someone has a blunt force to the hand and they end up having their hand amputated, typically they will continue to feel pain in their phantom hand, which is pretty wild, and that's because the representation of that hand is still intact in the cortex, in the brain, and it's trying to balance its levels of activity. Normally it's getting what's called proprioceptive feedback. Proprioception is just our knowledge of where our limbs are in space. It's an extremely important aspect of our somatosensory system, and there's no proprioceptive feedback and so a lot of the circuits start to ramp up their levels of activity and they become very conscious of the phantom limb. Before my lab was at Stanford, I was at UC San Diego and one of my colleagues was a guy, everyone just calls him by his last name, Ramachandran, who is famous for understanding this phantom limb phenomenon and developing a very simple but very powerful solution to it that speaks to the incredible capacity of top-down modulation,",

This is not about mind, I guess, as much as it is brain to control our perceptions of our body. What did Ramachandran do? Ramachandran had people who were missing a limb put their intact limb into a box that had mirrors in it such that when they looked in the box and they moved their intact limb, the opposite limb, which was a reflection of the intact limb 'cause they're missing the opposite limb, they would see it as if it was intact, and as they would move their intact limb, they would visualize with their eyes the limb that's in the place of the absent limb, so this is all by mirrors, moving around and they would feel immediate relief from the phantom pain, and he would tell them and they would direct their hand toward a orientation that felt comfortable to them. Then they would exit the mirror box, they would take their hand out, and they would feel as if the hand was now in its relaxed normal position. You could get real time, in moments, remapping of the representation of the hand. Now, that's amazing. This is the kind of thing that all of us would like to be able to do if we are in pain. If you stub your toe, if you break your ankle, if you take a hard fall on your bike or if you're in chronic pain. Wouldn't it be amazing to be able to use a mind trick, but it's not a trick because it's real, visual imagery, to remap your representation of your body surface and where your body is. That is something that we could all benefit from because if you do anything for long enough, including live, you're going to experience pain of some sort, and this, again I just want to remind you, isn't just about physical injuries and pain, this has direct relevance to emotional pain as well, which, of course, we'll talk about. The Ramachandran studies were really profound because they said a couple things. One, plasticity can be very fast, that it can be driven by the experience of something, just the visual experience. He had people do this mirror box thing but not look into the mirror box and they didn't get the remapping, so it required visual imagery coming in.

By replacing the normal hearing apparatus that's deficient in deaf people with this cochlear implant, the brain can make sense of this artificial ear, basically, it's not the outside ear, not the pinna, but the inner ear, and they can start to hear sounds. Some people really like the artificial cochlea. They really benefit from it. It restores their ability to hear and they like it. Other people don't. Some deaf people would prefer not to hear anything, can be very disruptive to them, and some of that might have to do with the need for further better engineering of these artificial cochleas, but all this really speaks to the fact that the brain is an adaptive device. It will respond to what you give it. It is not a device that is fixed. In fact, the essence of the brain, especially the human brain, is to take sensory inputs and to make sense of those, meaning cognitive sense, and then to interpret those signals, and so this may come as a shock to some of you and by no means am I trying to be insensitive, but pain is a perceptual thing as much as it's a physical thing.",

In people's pursuit for neuroplasticity, a question that comes up every once in a while is people will say, \"If I just brush my teeth with the opposite hand for a couple nights in a row, will I get neuroplasticity?\" And the answer is probably yes. It's a deliberate action. You're focusing on it. There's an end goal. You're very likely to make errors, like jamming up into your lips and gums at first and then getting better at it, and as you heard in last episode, making errors is really important 'cause those errors are the signal that plasticity needs to happen, and then when you get the actions correct, then those correct actions are programmed in. I'm not sure that brushing one's teeth with the opposite hand is the most effective use of this incredible thing that we have, which is plasticity. It's not going to open up plasticity for many other things. If that were really important to you, for whatever reason, maybe you have a crowded bathroom and it's easier to do on one side or the other, then fine, but it's kind of hard to imagine why this would be a highly adaptive behavior, unless, of course, you have an injured limb or you're missing a limb, and that gets me to some really exciting and important studies that were performed mostly in the '90s as well as in the 2000s, and that, for now, there is really a solid base of data. There's really a center of mass around a particular set of experiments that point to particular protocols for how to overcome motor injury, and this may resonate with some of you",

                "transcript": "and this may resonate with some of you who've ever been injured to the point where you couldn't walk well, temporarily, I hope, or even longer. Think about a sprained ankle scenario or a broken arm scenario. We're all familiar with the stories of people having a cast on and then getting the cast off and the particular limb that wasn't being used that was casted is much smaller and atrophied. Most of that atrophy, you might be surprised to learn, is not because the muscles aren't being used. It's because the nerves sending signals to those muscles are not active and therefore the muscles aren't contracting. Work done by a guy named Timothy Schallert and his graduate students and postdocs, Theresa Jones and others, in the '90s and 2000s showed something really wonderful that I think we can all benefit from should we have an injury and even if we simply want to balance out imbalances in our motor activity, and I think all of us tend to be stronger on one side or the other side. Usually a right-handed person will be stronger in their left arm, not always, for compensatory reasons. Some other time we can talk about handwriting. The lefties likely will be stronger in their right arm, although it depends on whether or not people are hook righties, that's when you hook around and write from the top, or hook lefties. There are all sorts of theories about this that we can talk about, right brain, left brain, math proficiency, et cetera. In any event, what Schallert and colleagues showed was that if we have damage to our brain in the sensory motor pathways, any number of different sensory motor pathways, or we have damage to a limb, could be a leg, could be an arm, could be a hand, there's great benefit to restricting the use of the opposite, better-performing, uninjured limb or hand or other part of the body. They had about a dozen papers showing that if there was damage centrally in the brain or there was damage to a limb, so unilateral damage, as we say, one side, the thing to do is not to cast up the damaged side, although you need to do that to protect the limb, of course, from further damage. If it's a broken arm, you need to cast the arm or you need to brace the arm, but that the key thing was to restrict movement of the intact, uninjured, opposite limb, and when they did that, it forced some movement in the injured limb and remarkably, through connections from the two sides of the brain, through the corpus callosum, this huge fiber pathway that links the two sides of the brain, they saw plasticity on both sides of the brain. This makes sense when you hear it. Let's say I injure my left ankle and I'm limping along or I'm using crutches. You would think, well, the last thing you want to do is injure your opposite limb or not use your opposite limb. My right ankle is perfectly fine, but if I lean too hard on my right limb and I take all the work out of the left limb, the left ankle, that's actually setting up a situation where there's going to be runaway asymmetry in the central pathways and the nerve-to-muscle pathways on my left side, and so what they suggested and what they showed in a variety of experiments was that by encouraging activity of the injured limb, provided it could be done without pain, and importantly, not just exercising that limb or part of the body but restricting the opposite healthy part of the body, that the speed of recovery was significantly faster. Now, I want to repeat, you don't want to go injuring something further. That's probably the worst thing you could do, but in some cases where people have damage in their brain, the limbs are perfectly fine, but the motor signals aren't getting down to the limbs, and in that case, the limb is fine, so you actually are free to use either limb as much as you want, and in that case, you don't want to rely on the uninjured pathway too much. In fact, you want to restrict the uninjured pathway. I find these studies remarkable and they've been followed up on at the molecular level, at the cellar level many times, and I think the physiotherapists out there and the rest of you who are involved in sports medicine and some of the physicians will say, \"Well, of course that makes perfect sense,\" but oftentimes this is not what happens. Oftentimes what happens is it's all about resting and limiting inflammation, et cetera, of the injured limb or the limbs corresponding to the injured part of the brain, and these experiments and the collection of them point to the fact that the balance between the right and left side of our body is always dynamic. It's always being updated at the level of neural circuitry, the Ramachandran studies with the mirror box support that too, and that even slight imbalances in the two sides of the body can get amplified, and so when you're in a situation where one side is injured or the brain is injured representing one side of the body, the key thing to do is to really overwork the side that needs the work and to restrict the activity of the side that doesn't need the work because it's healthy, and this has great semblance to ocular dominance plasticity,",

I won't go into it in detail, but where the Nobel Prize winning neurobiologists Torsten Wiesel and David Hubel showed that if one eye is closed early in development, that the representation of the opposite eye in the brain is completely overtaken by the intact eye. This is important. It means that all of our senses and our movements are competing for space in our brain and so the way to think about the principle is anytime you're injured and you're hobbling along, you don't want to injure yourself further, but you want to try and compensate in the ways that respect this competition for neural real estate, and what that usually means is not relying on where you're still strong because that's just going to create runaway plasticity that's going to make it very hard for you to recover the motor function, and in some cases, the sensory function, of the damaged limb. Some of you may be wondering how long and how often one should restrict the activity of the intact or healthy limb, or limbs in some cases, and the answer is you don't have to do that all day, every day. These experiments centered on doing one or two hours of dedicated work, sensory motor work or, so for instance, if you had a sprained ankle on the left, you might spend part of the day where your left leg, provided it's not too painful, can be exercised, again, in a way that's not damaging to the injury, and the right limb can't contribute to that exercise. This might be peddling unilaterally on a stationary bike if you can do that. For a different type of limb injury, like an arm injury, this might be reaching, provided the shoulder is mobile, doing reaching. It might be even writing with the damaged side and then intentionally not writing with the preferred or undamaged side. This has been shown to accelerate the central plasticity and the recovery of function, which I think is what most people want when people are injured. They want to get back to doing what they were doing previously and they want to be able to do that without pain. This brings up another topic, which is definitely related to neuroplasticity and injury but is a more general one that I hear about a lot, which is traumatic brain injury. Many injuries are not just about the limb and the lack of use of the limb but concussion and head injury, and I want to emphasize I'm not a neurologist. I have many colleagues that are.",

We shouldn't think of TBI as just for the football players or just for the kids that had an injury or just for the person that was in the car accident. We want to learn about TBI and understand TBI for those folks, but we're also going to talk about TBI as it relates to general degradation of brain function because there's a certain resemblance there of TBI to general brain aging. Typically after TBI, there are a number of different things that happen and there are a huge range of things that can create TBI. Neurologists and the emergency room physicians are going to want to know was the skull itself injured or did the brain rattle around in the skull? Was there actually a breach through the skull? Is there a physical object in there? How many concussions has the person had? Everyone's situation with TBI is incredibly different, but there's a constellation of symptoms that many people, if not all people with TBI, report which is headache, photophobia, that lights become aversive, sleep disruption, trouble concentrating, sometimes mood issues. There's a huge range and of course the severity will vary, et cetera. In a previous episode, I mentioned the Kennard Principle. The Kennard Principle, named after the famous neurologist, named by and after the famous neurologist Margaret Kennard, said that if you're going to get a brain injury, better to get it early in life than later in life and that's because the brain has a much greater or heightened capacity for repairing itself early in life than later, but of course, none of us want TBI and you can't pick when you get your TBI. You can avoid certain activities that would give you TBI, but really, when it comes to TBI, there are a couple of things that are agreed upon across the board. The first one is, as much as possible you want to avoid a second traumatic brain injury or concussion. That's going to be a tough one for some of the athletes and even recreational athletes to swallow because they want to continue in their sport, and I'm not here to tell you that you should or you shouldn't, but that's simply the way that it is. For folks that are in military or that are in certain professions, construction is a place where we see a lot of TBI. It's not always just football. A lot of construction workers are dealing with heavy objects swinging around in space. They wear those hardhat helmets, which unfortunately don't protect much against a lot of those blunt forces and certainly not against falls and things of that sort. Many people, in order to survive and feed their families, have to go back to work. It's very clear that regardless of whether or not there was a skull break and regardless of when the TBI happened and how many times it's happened, that the system that repairs the brain, the adult brain, is mainly centered around this lymphatic system that we call, for the brain, the glymphatic system.",

It's sort of like a sewer system that clears out the debris that surrounds neurons, especially injured neurons, and the glymphatic system is very active during sleep. It's been imaged in functional magnetic resonance imaging and the glymphatic system is something that you want very active because it's going to clear away the debris that sits between the neurons, and the cells that surround the connections between the neurons, called the glia, those cells are actively involved in repairing the connections between neurons when damaged. The glymphatic system is so important that many people, if not all people who get TBI, are told, \"Get adequate rest, you need to sleep,\" and that's kind of twofold advice. On the one hand, it's telling you to get sleep because all these good things happen in sleep. It's also about getting those people to not continue to engage in their activity full time or really try and hammer through it. You might say, \"Well, if you have trouble sleeping, how are you supposed to get deep sleep?\" Most of the activity of the glymphatic system, this wash out of the debris, is occurring during slow-wave sleep. Slow-wave sleep, as I mentioned in a previous episode, is something that happens typically in the early part of the evening. Even for those of you that are falling, or early part of the night, rather, if you're falling asleep and then waking up three, four hours later, it's important that you continue to get sleep but know that the slow-wave sleep is mainly packed toward the early part of the night, so that hopefully will alleviate some of the anxiety of the 3:00 and 4:00 am wake up, although you really should follow some of the protocols that I've suggested and your physician's protocols in order to try and get regular, longer sleep of seven, eight hours. Later, we're going to talk about the eight-hour mark as a prerequisite for repair. The glymphatic system has been shown to be activated further in two ways. One is that sleeping on one side, not on back or stomach, seems to increase the amount of wash out,",

There aren't a ton of data on this, but the data that exist are pretty solid. Again, sleeping on one side or with feet slightly elevated, as well, has been shown to increase the rate of clearance of some of the debris and that's because the way that the glymphatic system works is it has a physical pressure fluid dynamic to it that allow it to work more efficiently when one is sleeping on their side or with feet slightly elevated. This means not falling asleep in a chair while watching TV. This means, if possible, not falling asleep on one's back or on one's stomach, sleeping on one's side, and if you can't do that, I don't really like to sleep on my side. I sleep with my feet slightly elevated. I put a thin pillow under my ankles. I don't have TBI, but I have had a few concussions before, but right now I feel fine, but I find that putting the pillow under my ankles helps me sleep much more deeply and I wake up feeling much more refreshed. The other thing that has been shown to improve the function of the glymphatic system, and this is, again, is for sake of TBI as well as for everyone, even without brain injury, is a certain form of exercise, and I want to be very, very clear here.

Take your physician's advice as to whether or not you should be exercising at all and how much and then to what intensity. However, there's some interesting data, and we can provide a link to the review on this. It shows that exercise of what I guess people would nowadays call it Zone 2 cardio, which is low-level cardio that one could do while talking to somebody else. You could maintain a conversation, although you don't have to talk to somebody else. It just gives you a sense of the intensity of the exercise. That Zone 2 cardio for 30 to 45 minutes 3 times a week seems to improve the rates of clearance of some of the debris after injury, and in general, injury or no, to accelerate and improve the rates of flow for the glymphatic system. I find this really interesting because I think nowadays there's such an obsession with high-intensity interval training and people trying to pack in as much as they can into a short workout, which is great if it brings people to the table who haven't been exercising before, but I think it's really important that we know that the data on exercise and its relationship to brain health speak to doing 30 to 45 minutes of this what we call low-level cardio. It could be fast walking. It could be jogging if you can do that with your injury safely. It could be cycling. This is not the kind of workout that's designed to get your heart rate up to the point where you're improving your fitness levels at some sort of massive rate or taking huge jumps in your VO2 max or anything like that. This is exercise, I do this and I know a number of other people, especially people in communities where there is a lot of TBI, are now starting to adopt this, that the 30 to 45 minutes 3 times a week or so, could be more, of this Zone 2 type cardio can be very beneficial for washout of debris from the brain, and this is really interesting outside of TBI because what we know from aging is that aging is a nonlinear process. It's not like with every year of life your brain gets a little older. Sometimes it follows what's more like a step function where you get these big jumps in markers of aging. I guess that we could think of them as jumps down because it's a negative thing for most everybody. We'd like to live longer and be healthier in brain and body, and so the types of exercise I'm referring to now are really more about brain longevity and about keeping the brain healthy than they are about physical fitness. There's no reason why you couldn't do this and also, provided, again, it's safe for you given your brain state and injury state, et cetera, there's no reason why you couldn't also combine it with weight training and other forms of cardio. I think this is really interesting and if some of you would like to know the mechanism or at least the hypothesized mechanism, there's a molecule called aquaporin-4.",

It almost sounds like the fourth in a sequel of movies or something like that, but aquaporin-4 is a molecule that is related to the glial system. Glia are the, it means glue in Latin, are these cells in the brain, the most numerous cells in the brain, in fact, that ensheathe synapses, but they're very dynamic cells. They're like little ambulant cells. The microglia will run in and will gather up debris and soak it up and then run out after an injury. Aquaporin-4 is mainly expressed by the glial cell called the astrocyte. Astro, it looks like a little star. Incredibly interesting cells and the thing to remember is that the astrocytes bridge the connection between the neurons, the synapse, the connections between them, and the vasculature, the blood system, and the glymphatic system. They sit at the interface and they kind of, imagine somebody on an emergency site, car crash site, who's directing everybody around as to what to do. Get that person on a stretcher, bandage them up, call their mother, et cetera, et cetera, get this out of the road, put down some flares. The astrocytes work in that capacity as well as doing some things more directly. This glymphatic system and the glial astrocyte system is a system that we want chronically active throughout the day as much as possible, so low-level walking, Zone 2 cardio, and then at night, during slow-wave sleep, is then really when this glymphatic system kicks in. That should hopefully be an actionable takeaway, provided that you can do that kind of cardio safely, that I believe everybody should be doing who cares about brain longevity, not just people who are trying to get over TBI. Now I'd like to return a little bit to some of the subjective aspects of pain modulation because I think it's so interesting and so actionable",

Here are a couple examples. First of all, anyone who's ever done combat sports or martial arts knows that it's incredible how little a punch hurts during a fight and it's incredible how much it hurts after a fight. The molecule adrenaline, when it's liberated into our body, truly blunts our experience of pain. We all know the stories of people walking miles on stumped legs, people doing all sorts of things that were incredible feats that allowed them to move through what would otherwise be pain, and afterward they do experience extreme pain, but during the event oftentimes they are not experiencing pain and that's because of the pain-blunting effects of adrenaline. I'll tell you exactly how this works in a few minutes when we talk about acupuncture, but norepinephrine binding to particular receptors, adrenaline binding to particular receptors actually shuts down pain pathways. People who anticipate an injection of morphine immediately report the feeling of loss of pain. Their pain starts to diminish because they know they're going to get pain relief and it's a powerful effect. All of you are probably saying placebo effect. Placebo effects are very real. Placebo effects and belief effects, as they're called, have a profound effect on our experience of noxious stimuli like pain and they can also have a profound effect on positive stimuli and things that we're looking forward to. One study that I think is particularly interesting here, it's from my colleague at Stanford, Sean Mackey. They did a neuroimaging study. They subjected people to pain. In this case, it was a heat pain. People have very specific thresholds to heat",

If people are looking at an image or thinking about a person that they love, or even a thing that they love, a pet that they love, studies previous to the one that Mackey and colleagues did showed that their experience of pain was reduced. Their threshold for pain was higher. They could tolerate more pain and they reported it as not as painful, but there's a twist there which is it turns out that the extent to which love will modulate pain has everything to do with how infatuated and obsessed somebody is with the object of their love. People that report thinking about somebody, or a pet, for many hours of the day, kind of having an obsessive nature, almost like what people might call quote, unquote, codependency. For those of you that are listening, I'm just providing air quotes 'cause codependency is kind of a clinical thing now although it's thrown around a lot all the time. It's sort of like gaslighting. People talk about gaslighting all the time now. Gaslighting is a real thing but then people talked about gaslighting for many things outside the clinical description. If people are very obsessed with somebody, they have a kind of obsessive love of somebody's face, even if the other person doesn't know them, which is a little weird, that response, that feeling of love internally can blunt the pain experience to a significant degree. These are not small effects. It's not just that love can protect us from pain. It's that infatuation and obsession can protect us from pain, and not surprisingly, how early a relationship is, how new a relationship is directly correlates with people's ability, they showed, to use this love, this internal representation of love, to blunt the pain response. For those of you that have been with your partners for many years and you love them very much and you're obsessed with them, terrific. You have a pre-installed, well, I suppose it's not pre-installed. You had to do the work because relationships are work, but you've got a installed mechanism for blunting pain, and again, these are not minor effects. These are major effects and it's all going to be through that top-down modulation that we talked about, not unlike the mirror box experiments with phantom limb that relieve phantom pain or some other top-down modulation, and the opposite example was the nail through the boot, which is a visual image that made the person think it was painful when in fact it was painful even though there was no tissue damage. It was all perceptual. The pain system is really subject to these perceptual influences, which is remarkable because, really, when we think about the somatosensory system, it has this cognitive component, it's got this peripheral component, but there's another component which is the way in which our sensation, our somatosensory system is woven in with our autonomic nervous system, and we're going to get to that next, but I want to just raise the idea that the reason that this kind of infatuation",

It's very distinct from the kind of love chemicals, if you will, I don't even like calling them love chemicals. That just feels weird. If this were text, I would delete that line, but from the chemicals associated with warmth and connection, such as serotonin and oxytocin, which tend to be for more stable, long-lasting relationships. Dopamine is what dilates the pupils, which gets people really excited. They can't stop thinking about somebody. The text messages are even exciting. They write to them and they can't wait for the text message to come back, the dot dot dot on the screen. The text message is excruciating. They don't respond for two minutes and people are getting flipped out. I'm not here to support that kind of whatever, what I'm saying is that that obsessive type of love, which without question is going to be associated with the dopamine pathway, does seem to have a utility in the context of reducing the unpleasantness of physical pain, and probably has a lot to do with reducing the unpleasantness of a lot of life, like sitting in traffic, et cetera, because when we talk about pain, emotional pain and physical pain start to become one in the same. They are so closely intertwined that the lines between them neurally become very blurry. What do I mean by that? Well, if love and infatuation can reduce pain, presumably through the release of dopamine, well, then does dopamine release itself blunt pain? Should we be chasing dopamine release as a way to treat chronic and acute pain? And that's exactly what we're going to talk about now. Independent of love, we're going to talk about something quite different which is putting needles and electricity in different parts of the body, so-called acupuncture.

These are big university centers. In fact, my source for everything I'm about to tell you next is Professor Qiufu Ma at Harvard Medical School and his papers. I stand behind the information that I'm going to provide today, but it's extracted largely from the Ma lab's papers which use very rigorous variable-isolating experiments to address just how does something like acupuncture work, and I think what you'll be interested in and surprised to learn is that it does work, but sometimes it can exacerbate pain and sometimes it can relieve pain and it all does that through very discrete pathways for which we can really say, \"This neuron connects to that neuron connects to the adrenals,\" and we can tie this all back to dopamine because in the end it's the chemicals and neural circuits that are giving rise to these perceptions, or these experiences, rather, of things that we call pain, love, et cetera. In a previous podcast episode, I mentioned my experience of visiting an acupuncturist and getting acupuncture. The acupuncture itself didn't really do that much for me, but I wasn't there for any specific reason. It was gifted to me by somebody and I wanted to try it. I'm not passing judgment on acupuncture. In fact, I know a number of people that really derive tremendous benefit from acupuncture for pain and for gastrointestinal issues. There are actually a lot of really good peer-reviewed studies supporting the use of acupuncture for, in particular, GI tract issues. In recent years, there's been an emphasis on trying to understand the mechanism of things like acupuncture and acupuncture itself, not to support acupuncture or to try to get everybody to do acupuncture but as a way to try and understand how these sorts of practices might actually benefit people who are experiencing pain or for changing the nervous system or brain-body relationship in general, and actually, the National Institutes of Health in the United States now has a entire subdivision, an institute within the National Institutes of Health, which is complementary health, and that institute is interested in things like acupuncture and a variety of other practices that, I think, 10, 15 years ago people probably thought were really alternative and maybe even counterculture, at least in the States, and it's exciting. I think people are starting to really take a look at what's going on under the hood for certain types of treatments that are very useful and I think it's very likely to lead to an expanded number of treatments for a number of different conditions. What I want to talk about in terms of acupuncture is the incredible way in which acupuncture illuminates the crosstalk between the somatosensory system, our ability to feel stuff externally, exteroception, internally, interoception, and how that somatosensory system is wired in with and communicating with our autonomic nervous system that regulates our levels of alertness or calmness. After that, I'm going to talk about how the acupuncture that's being done right now also points to relief for what's called referred pain. This takes us all back to the homunculus. Let's start there. We have this representation of our body surface in our brain. That representation is what we call somatotopic, and what somatotopy is is it just means that areas of your body that are near one another, so your thumb and your forefinger, for instance, are represented by neurons that are nearby each other in the brain. You might say, \"Well, duh,\" but actually, it didn't have to be that way. The neurons that represent the tip of my forefinger and the neurons that represent my thumb on the same hand could have been distantly located and therefore the map of my body surface, the homunculus, would be really disordered, but it's not that way. It's very ordered. It's very smooth. As, let's say you were to image my brain, if you were to stimulate my finger, my forefinger, and then march that stimulation across my finger, across the palm and to the nearby thumb, you would see that neurons in the brain would also make a sort of J shape in their pattern of activation. That means there's so-called somatotopy, but the connections from those brain neurons are sent into the body and they are synchronized with, meaning they cross-wire with and form synapses with some of the input from the viscera, from our guts, from our diaphragm, from our stomach, from our spleen, from our heart. Our internal organs are sending information up to this map in our brain of the body surface, but it's about internal information, what we call interoception, our ability to look inside or imagine inside and feel what we're feeling inside. The way to think about this accurately is that our representation of ourself is a representation of our internal workings, our viscera, our guts, everything inside our skin, and the surface of our skin, and the external world, what we're seeing. Those three things are always being combined in a very interesting, complex but very seamless way. Acupuncture involves taking needles, and sometimes electricity and or heat as well, and stimulating particular locations on the body and through these maps of stimulation that have been developed over thousands of years, mostly in Asia, but now this is a practice that's being done many places throughout the world, they have these maps that speak to, oh, well, if you stimulate this part of the body, you get this response, and if somebody has a gastrointestinal issue, like their guts are moving too quick, they have diarrhea, you stimulate this area and it'll slow their gut motility down, or if their gut motility is too slow, they're constipated, you stimulate someplace else and it accelerates it, and hearing about this stuff, it sounds kind of, to a Westerner who's not thinking about the underlying neural circuitry, it could sound kind of wacky. It really sounds like alternative or even really out there stuff, but when you look at the neural circuitry, the neuroanatomy, it really starts to make sense, and Qiufu Ma's lab at Harvard Medical School is an excellent laboratory, has been exploring how stimulation of different types, intense or weak, with heat or without heat, on different parts of the body can modulate pain and inflammation, and what they've shown in a particularly exciting study is that stimulation of the abdomen, anywhere on the midsection, weakly does nothing. \"Well, that's not very interesting,\" you might say. Intense stimulation of the abdomen, however, with this electroacupuncture has a very strong effect of increasing inflammation in the body, and this is important to understand because it's not just that stimulating the gut does this because you're activating the gut area. It activates a particular nerve pathway. For the aficionados, it's the splenic spinal sympathetic axis if you really want to know, and it's pro-inflammatory under most conditions. However, there are other conditions where if, for instance, the person is dealing with a particular bacterial infection, that can be beneficial, and this goes back to a much earlier discussion that we had on a previous podcast that we'll revisit again and again, which is that the stress response was designed to combat infection. It turns out that there are certain patterns of stimulation on the abdomen that can actually liberate immune cells from our immune organs, like our spleen, and counter infection through the release of things like adrenaline. Qiufu's lab also showed that stimulation of the feet and hands can reduce inflammation, and again, this was done mechanistically. This was done by blocking certain pathways with the appropriate control experiments. This was done not in any kind of subjective way. This was also done by measuring particular molecules, IL-6 and cytokines and things that are related to the inflammation response, and what they showed is that the stimulation of the, in particular, the hind limbs at low intensity led to increases in the activity of this vagal pathway. The vagus nerve being this 10th cranial nerve that serves the rest and digest and parasympathetic, in other words, calming response. What this means is that we are now at the front edge of this research field that's, it's early days still, but it's discovering that depending on whether or not the stimulation is intense or mild and depending on where the stimulation is done on the body you can get very different effects. This points to the idea that you can't say acupuncture good or acupuncture bad. There has to be a systematic understanding of what exactly the effect is that you're trying to achieve and the underlying basis for this is really relevant to the thing about adrenaline that I said before, that in a fight, it's rare that you ever feel pain when you get hit, I've experienced that, but later it hurts a lot. It turns out that when you stimulate these pathways that activate, in particular, the adrenals, the adrenal gland liberates norepinephrine and epinephrine and the brain does as well, it binds to what are called the beta noradrenergic receptors. This is really getting down into the weeds, but the beta noradrenergic receptors activate the spleen which liberates cells that combat infection and it's anti-inflammatory. That's the short-term quick response. The more intense stimulation of the abdomen and other areas can be pro-inflammatory because of the ways that they trigger certain loops that go back to the brain and trigger the anxiety pathways and that place people into a state of anxiety that exacerbates pain. One pathway stimulates norepinephrine and blunts pain, the other one doesn't. What does all this mean? How are we supposed to put all of this together? Well, there's a paper that was published",

You'll say, \"Well, what am I supposed to do with all this information?\" What this means is that there are real maps of our body surface that when stimulated communicate with our autonomic nervous system, the system that controls alertness or calmness, and thereby releases either molecules like norepinephrine and dopamine, which make us more alert, as we would be in a fight, and blunt our response to pain and they reduce inflammation, but there are yet other pathways that when stimulated are pro-inflammatory, and that brings us to the question of what is all this inflammation stuff that people are talking about?

Inflammation is terrific. Inflammation is the reason why cells are called to the site of injury to clear it out. Inflammation is what's going to allow you to heal from any injury. Chronic inflammation is bad, but acute inflammation is absolutely essential. Remember those kids that we talked about earlier that have mutations in these receptors for sensing pain? They never get inflammation and that's why their joints literally disintegrate. It's really horrible because they don't actually have the inflammation response because it was never triggered by the pain response. Inflammation can be very beneficial. There's a lot of interest nowadays in taking things and doing things to limit inflammation. One of the ones that comes up a lot is turmeric. I'm sure the moment anyone starts talking about inflammation the question is, \"What about turmeric?\" I have talked before about turmeric elsewhere. I am very skeptical of turmeric and I might lose a few friends, although that'd be weird if my friend, that would say something about my friendships if I lost friends over a discussion about turmeric, but in any case, turmeric does have anti-inflammatory properties, there's no question about that, but as we've just described, inflammation can be a very good thing, at least in the short term. The other thing about turmeric is there was a study published out of Stanford in collection with some work from other universities showing that a lot of turmeric is heavily contaminated with lead. The lead is used to get that really rich, dense, orange coloring to it that everyone wants to see, so you have to check your sources of turmeric. The other thing is, for men in particular, turmeric can be very antagonistic to dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone is the more dominant form of androgen in human males and it's involved in things like aggression and libido and things of that sort. Many people that I've talked to who have have taken turmeric get a severe blunting of affect and libido. For some people that might be a serious negative. I certainly avoid turmeric. I don't like turmeric for that reason. I also think that the inflammation response is a healthy response. You have to keep it in check and we're going to talk about specific practices for wound healing and injury in a moment, but this idea that just inflammation is bad and you want to reduce inflammation across the board, nothing could be further from the truth. We have pathways that exist in our body specifically to increase inflammation. It's the inflammation that goes unchecked, just like stress, which is problematic for repair, for brain injury, and it can exacerbate certain forms of dementia, et cetera, but I'd like to create a little bit more nuance or a lot more nuance, if possible, in the conversation around inflammation because people have just taken this discussion around inflammation to be this idea that just inflammation is bad and nothing could be further from the truth.

                "transcript": "has this breathing that's similar to Tummo breathing, as it was originally called, involves basically hyperventilating and then doing some exhales and some breath holds. A couple of things about that. It should never be done near water. People who have done it near water unfortunately have drowned. It's certainly not for everybody and I'm not here to either promote it nor discourage people from doing it, but I think we should ask ourselves, \"What is the net effect of that?\" Because a number of people have asked me about it in relation to pain management. The effect of doing that kind of breathing, it's not a mysterious effect. It liberates adrenaline from the adrenals. There is a paper published in the \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,\" which is a very fine journal, showing that that breathing pattern can counter infection from endotoxin and that's because when you have adrenaline in your system and when the spleen is very active, that response is used to counter infection and stress counters infection. We'll talk about this more going forward, but the idea that stress lends itself to infection is false. Stress counters infection by liberating killer cells in the body. You don't want the stress response to stay on indefinitely, however. Things like Wim Hof breathing, like ice baths, anything that releases adrenaline will counter the infection, but you want to regulate the duration of that adrenaline response. This should make perfect sense. We, as a species, had to evolve under conditions of famine and cold. Actually, Texas right now is an extreme case of cold and power outage. I've seen the pictures and a lot of people out there are really suffering. Their systems are releasing a ton of adrenaline. They're cold. Some of them are likely to be hungry. They're probably stressed. They're releasing a lot of adrenaline which is keeping them safe from infection. After they get their heat back on and they relax and they can finally warm up again, which we would like for them very soon, hopefully by the time this podcast comes out, that will have already happened, that's typically when people get sick because the immune response is blunted as the stress response starts to subside. Stress, inflammation, countering infection, that comes from endotoxin, that comes from any number of things. It can be from cold. It can be from hyperventilation. It can be from a physical threat. It can be from the stress of an exam or an upcoming surgery. This adrenaline thing and the inflammation associated with it is adaptive. It's highly adaptive. It is a short-term plasticity that is designed to make us better for what we're experiencing and challenged with, not worse, and so hopefully that will add an additional layer to this whole idea that stress is bad, inflammation is bad, et cetera. Again, I'm not suggesting people do or don't do something like Wim Hof, Tummo breathing, I just want to point to the utility. It's very similar to the utility from cold showers, ice baths and other forms of anything that increase adrenaline. Every episode, I want to make sure that every listener comes away with as much knowledge as possible but also actionable tools, and today we've talked about a variety of tools, but I want to center in on a particular sequence of tools that hopefully you won't need, but presumably if you're a human being and you're active,",

It's about managing injury and recovering and healing fast or at least as fast as possible. It includes removing the pain. It includes getting mobility back and getting back to a normal life, whatever that means for you. I want to emphasize that what I'm about to talk about next was developed in close consultation with Kelly Starrett, who many of you probably have heard of before. Kelly can be found at The Ready State. He's a formally trained, so degreed and educated, exercise physiologist. He's a world expert in movement and tissue rehabilitation, et cetera. They're not sponsors of the podcast. Kelly is a friend and a colleague. He's somebody that I personally trust and his views on tissue rehabilitation and injury I think are really grounded extremely well in both medicine, physiology, and the real cutting edge of what's new and what you might not get in terms of advice from the typical person. All that said, you always, always, always should consult with your physician before adopting any protocols or removing any protocols. I asked Kelly, I made it really simple, I said, \"Okay, let's say I were to sprain my ankle or break my arm or injure my knee or ACL tear or something like that or shoulder injury, what are the absolute necessary things to do regardless of situation and what science is this grounded in?\" And then I made it a point to go find the studies that either supported or refuted what he was telling me because that's why I'm here. The first one is a very basic one, that now you have a lot of information to act on, which is in terms of what we know about tissue rehabilitation, both brain and body, we know that sleep is essential, and so we both agreed that eight hours minimum in bed per night is critical. What was interesting, however, is that it doesn't have to be eight hours of sleep. We acknowledged that some of that time might be challenging to get to sleep, especially if one is in pain or mobility is limited. We forget how often we roll over in bed or how the conditions of our sleeping can impact those injuries too. Kelly acknowledged, and I agree, that eight hours of sleep would be ideal, but if not, at least eight hours immobile and that speaks to the power of these non-sleep deep rest protocols too. If you can't sleep, doing non-sleep deep rest protocols, we've provided links to them before, we're going to continue to provide links to the previous ones and new ones are coming soon, that is extremely beneficial. That's a non-negotiable in terms of getting the foundation for allowing for glymphatic clearance and tissue clearance, et cetera. The other is, if possible, unless it's absolutely excruciating or you just can't do it, a 10-minute walk per day, of course you don't want to exacerbate the injury, at least a 10-minute walk per day and probably longer. This is where it gets interesting. I was taught, I learned that when you injure yourself,",

                "transcript": "I was taught, I learned that when you injure yourself, you're supposed to ice something. You're supposed to put ice on it, but I didn't realize this, but when speaking to exercise physiologists and some physicians, they said that the ice is really more of a placebo. It numbs the environment of the injury, which is not surprising, and will eliminate the pain for a short while, but it has some negative effects that perhaps offset its use. One, it sludges, it creates sludging within the blood and other lymphatic tissue, so it actually can create some clotting and sludging of the tissue and fluids, the fascial interface with muscle, and a number of the stuff that's supposed to be flowing through there can slow up and increase inflammation in the wrong way, can actually restrict movement out of the injury site, which is bad because you want the macrophages and the other cell types phagocytosing, eating up, the debris in an injury and moving it out of there so that it can repair. That was surprising to me which made me ask, \"Well, then what about heat?\" Well, it turns out heat is actually quite beneficial. A lot of people talk about heat shock proteins and all these genetic pathways and protein pathways that can be activated by heat. Very little data to support the idea that heat shock proteins are part of the wound healing process, at least in terms of the sorts of conventional heat that one could use like a hot water bottle or a hot bath or a hot compress. The major effects seem to be explained by heat improving the viscosity of the tissues and the clearance and the perfusion of fluid, blood, lymph and other fluids, out of the injury area. That's really interesting. I didn't know this. I thought, well, you're supposed to ice something. I said, well, whenever I would see a kid get injured in soccer, never me, of course, no, of course I got injured in soccer from time to time, they give you an ice pack and the ice pack removes some of the pain. I think the consensus now, which was surprising to me, is that the ice pack is actually more of the top-down modulation. You think you're doing something for the pain and there's some interesting studies that actually showed the placebo effect of the ice pack, so ice packs are placebo, perhaps. That's interesting. I'll underline perhaps because who knows? Maybe there's some people out there that are going to say this is totally crazy and the ice is actually very beneficial, but it seems like heat, mobility, sleep, keeping movement, and it turns out that the movement itself can act as a bit of an analgesic, it can actually reduce the pain, whereas the ice reduces the pain but sludges the tissue and keeps the cells that need to be removed from leaving the area. What's also interesting is in neuroscience we know that if we want to kill neurons or silence neurons, we cool them. This is a well-known tool in the laboratory. Some of the early and most important studies in neuroscience that formed the basis for the textbooks were lowering a cooling probe into a particular area of the brain or a peripheral nerve in order to shut down that nerve, so the cooling will shut down the nerve, but another very well-known fact in neuroscience text books is that when the activity of the nerve pathway or neurons comes back, there's what's called homeostatic plasticity, that it rebounds with greater pain, with a higher level of intensity, which in the pain system would equate to greater pain. Regardless of where these neurons are in the body, if you stimulate a neuron, it's active. If you cool it, it becomes inactive and when the neuron heats back up after being cooled, it becomes hyperactive, and so this makes really good sense as to why heat, provided it's not damaging levels of heat, would be more beneficial for wound healing and for reducing pain in the short and long run than would be cold or ice, which I find very interesting. In terms of chronic pain, the manuscripts on this, my discussion with Kelly and with others, point to the fact that chronic pain is basically plasticity gone wrong. It's sort of like PTSD for the emotional system and the stress system, and chronic pain is going to involve a number of different protocols",

                "desc": "Chronic and/or Whole Body Pain; Red-Light Therapy, Sunlight",
                "transcript": "a number of different protocols to rewire both the brain centers and the peripheral centers associated with chronic pain. Certain things like fibromyalgia, for instance, which is whole-body pain, relate to too little inhibition. In the brain, you have excitation and inhibition. They come from different sources of neurons. The inhibition is mainly from GABA and glycine and things like that. In fibromyalgia, there's too little central, within the brain, modulation of the pain responses so that people experience whole-body pain. In that case, the emerging therapies are really interesting. I have a friend who works for the National Institutes of Health who unfortunately suffers from fibromyalgia who asked me about this a lot and his question and what he's now actually exploring is red light therapy. Something that I've talked about on various Instagram posts. Red light therapy typically is talked about in terms of mitochondria and the data on that are not so terrific, at least not really published in blue ribbon journals in most cases, except for one study that I'm aware of from Glen Jeffery's lab at University College London showing that red light stimulation to the eyes in people 40 or older can offset some of the effects of macular degeneration by improving the health of the photo receptors. People with fibromyalgia, which is this whole-body pain, are now starting to use red light therapies. When I asked Kelly and others and some experts in pain, \"What are your thoughts on this red light therapy for things like fibromyalgia and pain, especially red light local therapy?\" Their idea, and I don't think this is a field that's progressed far enough now to really place any firm conclusions on, but the idea is that red light therapy locally may have some effect, but the systemic red light therapy, this is like wearing protection to the eyes, in some cases, so not for the treatment of macular degeneration but wearing protection of the eyes and getting very bright red light therapy in many ways may be, and to use Kelly's words, \"Approximating the effects of nature.\" These are like surrogate technologies for getting outside in the sunshine. When you're in the sun, it might not look red, but there are a lot of red wavelengths coming toward you. The red light therapies may have some utility, but getting into sunlight may actually have as much or more effect. Of course, if these wounds are on a part of the body that you can't expose, then you could imagine why the red light therapy might be good. I don't know, depending on the neighborhood you live in, that may or may not be a weird thing to go outside and expose your body to sunlight. Probably a number of factors that dictate whether or not that'd be weird or not, but that's up to you, not me, and it seems that, so movement, heat, not ice, light, sleep, and in some cases, the use, and I'll talk about this in a moment, that some cases the use of restricting above and below the injury to then release and then increase perfusion through the site may actually accelerate the wound healing. All of this might sound just like common sense knowledge, but to me, at least as a 45-year-old, I always just thought it's ice, it's non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, it's things that block prostaglandins, so things like aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen. Those things generally work by blocking things, they're called the COX prostaglandin blockers and things of that sort, things in that pathway. Those sorts of treatments which reduce inflammation may not be so great at the beginning when you want inflammation, they may be important for limiting pain so people can be functional at all, but the things that I talked about today really are anchored in three principles. One is that the inflammation response is a good one. This is what we're learning from Qiufu Ma's lab's work on acupuncture. The immediate acute inflammation response is good. It calls to the site of injury things that are going to clean up the injury and bad cells. Then there are going to be things that are going to improve perfusion, like the glymphatic system, getting deep sleep, feet elevated, sleeping on one side, low-level Zone 2 cardio three times a week. Red light, perhaps, is going to be useful",

Later, cells get what's called restricted in their lineage, so a skin cell, unless you do some fancy molecular gymnastics to it, you can't actually turn that cell into a neuron. Yamanaka won the Nobel Prize for finding these Yamanaka factors which you could give a skin cell to turn into a neuron, but that's not an approved therapy at this time, but many people ask me about platelet-rich plasma, so-called PRP. They take blood, they enrich for platelets, and they re-inject it back into people. Here's the deal. This deserves an entire episode. It has never been shown whether or not the injection itself is what's actually creating the effect. This is something that the acupuncture literature suffered from for a long time, that the sham control, as it's called, sham, we don't mean it's a sham, but in science you say a sham control meaning you do everything exactly the same way you would. So for acupuncture, you would bring the needle right up to the skin, but you wouldn't actually poke it into the skin, for instance. That would be a sham control. With a drug treatment, you would inject a drug into a person and then the control, the sham control, would be that you would bring the injection over, you might do the injection or not do the injection 'cause you imagine that the injection itself could have an effect. It's never really been shown whether or not PRP has effects that are separate from injecting a volume of fluid into a tissue. The claims that PRP actually contains stem cells are very, very feeble, and when you look at the literature and you talk to anyone expert in the stem cell field, they will tell you that it's, the number of stem cells in PRP is infinitesimally small. In fact, so much so that these places that inject PRP for injuries are not allowed to advertise through the use of the words stem cells. It's actually illegal at this point, at least as far as I know. It was through the end of last year and I'm guessing it still is now. Stem cells are an exciting area of technology. However, there's a clinic down in Florida that was shut down a couple of years ago for injecting stem cells harvested from patients into the eye for macular degeneration. These were people that were suffering from poor vision and very shortly after injecting the stem cells into the eyes, they went completely blind. I'm somebody who is very skeptical of the stem cell treatment work that's out there. It's actually very hard to get in the United States for this reason. It's not approved. The PRP treatments are very complicated. The marketing around them is shaky at best. I'm sure a number of people will say that they had PRP and benefited from it tremendously and I don't doubt that. Whether or not it was placebo, today we talked a lot about top-down control, that's just a variant on the word placebo, belief effects, whether or not it was placebo or not, I don't know. I wasn't there. That's for you to decide and I'm not here to tell you that you should or shouldn't do something, but I do think that anything involving stem cells, one should be very cautious of. You should also be very cautious of anyone that tells you that PRP is injecting a lot of stem cells. This is an evolving area that really needs a lot more work and attention. The major issue with stem cells that I think is concerning is that stem cells are cells that want to become lots of different things, not just the tissue that you're interested in. If you damage your knee and you inject stem cells into your knee, you need to molecularly restrict those stem cells so that they don't become tumor cells. A tumor is a collection of stem cells. When you get something horrible like glioblastoma in the brain, which is a terrible thing to have, it's glial cells that returned to stemness, excessive stemness, they've started to produce too many of themselves, and glioblastoma is often deadly, not always. Injecting stem cells, it sounds great, and it sounds like something that one would want to do, but one needs to approach this with extreme caution, even if it's your own blood or stem cells that you're re-injecting. I think those technologies are coming. They're on the way. If any of you are devotees of PRP, tell me your experiences with them. I'm curious. I want to see the papers. I want to know the evidence, and of course, there are always folks out there that say, \"I don't care what the scientists and the physicians and the FDA say. I just want to do this,\" and if that's your stance, that's your stance. I'm not here to govern that, but I do think that people should be informed, and in thinking about tissue recovery and injury, that's what I was able to glean. Again, check out what Kelly and his coworkers are doing at The Ready State. It's phenomenal and they've worked with all the top people in just about every domain of life, it seems. Very high-integrity folks. Some of you are probably saying, \"Well, I'm not injured. I'm not an athlete. I don't want stem cell injections. I don't have,\" again, I'm saying you shouldn't get stem cell injections for now. Please hold off until the field learns more about how to do that safely, but I want to talk about and end with a really interesting and somewhat weird technology,",

                "transcript": "and somewhat weird technology, which is baby blood. I have a colleague at Stanford, his name is Tony Wyss-Coray, and in 2014 his laboratory published a study showing that the blood of young rodents, mice and rats, when transfused into old, demented rodents, mice and rats, made those old, demented rodents recover much of their memory and seem much more vital and energetic, better recall of different spatial learning tasks. Tissue and wound healing, they've since shown, can be improved in these older animals. It's pretty incredible. They went on to show several years later that blood from umbilical cords, I'm not making this up, blood from umbilical cords can do the same and this is the basis of a biotech company. Actually, one of my former postdocs is now an employee there. They've isolated the molecules from young blood that seems to vitalize or revitalize the old brain and body, and one of those molecules goes by the name TIMP2. T-I-M-P-2. Where's all this going? Well, I don't know how long it's going to be before there are treatments based on these blood transfusions. I doubt that blood transfusions themselves from young people into old people is going to be used for the treatment of dementia, although it might, as weird as it seems. We know that transfusions of all sorts of stuff, for instance, fecal transplants are being used to treat obesity. The gut microbiome of thin people is being, not transfused, but is being transplanted into the colons and guts of obese people and leading to weight loss, which sounds really wild and is not a topic I particularly enjoy talking about, but nonetheless, it points to the importance of the gut microbiome in regulating things like blood sugar and health as it relates to obesity and diabetes and all sorts of things. It does appear that there are things, factors in the blood of young members of a given species that are lost over time in the older members of that species. I'm not going to give you a tool on the basis of these findings today. I am not going to tell you to consume any fluid from any other member of your species, our species, for any reason, but I do think that it's important to mention that the science is asking questions such as what are the factors within the brain that allow the young brain to recover so much better than the older brain from injury, from all sorts of things, events, et cetera, and what are the factors in the older brain that are limiting, and thinking about identifying which factors are going to allow people to restore cognitive function, physical function, wound healing and so forth. It's a really exciting area. I mention it not to be sensationalist but because it's happening and because there's a lot of excitement about it and because I think it's clear that the young brain and body and blood are very different from the old brain, body and blood, and the goal of science is to identify and isolate those factors that make that so, such that people who would otherwise get dementia or perhaps even have dementia will be allowed to recover. Again, not an actionable item at this point, but one to think about, perhaps not too long, but one to think about. I'm going to close there. I've talked about a lot of tools today. I've talked a lot about somatosensation,",

I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we are going to discuss sugar, in particular, how our nervous system regulates our sugar intake and our are seeking of sugar. We're also going to discuss how sugar regulates our nervous system. And as you'll soon learn, sugar really impacts our brain and body by two main mechanisms. One of those mechanisms is based on the sweet taste of sugar, which itself is rewarding. Even if you're not much of a sweet tooth, I confess I'm not, most people enjoy sweet tastes more than bitter tastes. And the sweet taste of sugar and its various forms, is strongly reinforcing, meaning it triggers the activation of neurons, nerve cells in the brain and body, that make us want to consume more of that sweet substance. Incidentally, sweet tastes also make us want to eat more of other substances as well. You may be familiar with that phenomenon. Now sugar also triggers mechanisms in the brain and body based on its nutritive content, independent of its sweetness. What that means is that the actual caloric content and the way that sugar interacts with your nervous system at a subconscious level, without your awareness, also impacts your craving and seeking of sugar and other foods. Today, we are going to discuss what happens when you ingest sugar in terms of your body's reaction and your brain's reaction. We are also going to talk about what happens when you don't ingest enough sugar. 'Cause it turns out sugar is such a powerful fuel for the brain that under conditions where people don't ingest enough sugar, or where their so-called blood glucose, which is basically blood sugar of a particular form gets too low, their neurons don't function as well. That said, there are conditions of very low blood sugar in which neurons can function even better. So today we are going to talk about the ins and outs, the ups and downs of sugar as it relates to your nervous system. And by the end of this episode, I'm confident that you have a much clearer picture as to how much sugar you should be ingesting, whether or not you should avoid sugars that you're currently eating, and you will certainly understand much, much more about the energy and fuel sources that your brain relies on, which I'm certain will allow you to make better informed choices about the foods you eat and avoid toward mental health, physical health, and performance.

In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Thesis. Thesis makes what are called nootropics, which means smart drugs. Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics, I don't believe in smart drugs in the sense that I don't believe that there's any one substance or collection of substances that can make us smarter. I do believe, based on science, however, that there are particular neural circuits and brain functions that allow us to be more focused, more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera. That's just the way that the brain works, different neural circuits for different brain states. And so the idea of a nootropic that's to make us smarter all around, fails to acknowledge that smarter is many things. If you're an artist, you're a musician, you're doing math, you're doing accounting, at different parts of the day, you need to be creative. These are all different brain processes. Thesis understands this. And as far as I know they're the first nootropics company to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes. They only use the highest quality ingredients, which of course is essential. Some of those I've talked about on the podcast, things like DHA, Ginkgo biloba, phosphatidylserine. They give you the ability to try several different blends over the course of a month, discover which nootropics work best for your unique brain chemistry and genetics and goals. And with that personalization, design a kit of nootropics that's ideal for the different brain and body states you want to access. I've been using Thesis for more than six months now, and I can confidently say that their nootropics have been a total game changer. My go-to formula is the Clarity Formula, or sometimes I'll use their Energy Formula, before training. To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit, go online to take thesis.com/huberman.

                "transcript": "let's talk about how sugar impacts your brain, and how your brain impacts your pursuit or your avoidance of sugar. Let's get a few things out of the way first. The first thing is that there's nothing inherently bad about sugar. I know the word sugar gets a bad rap nowadays, and indeed, you're going to hear over and over again, during this podcast, that consuming a lot of refined sugars, in particular high fructose corn syrup, is known to have a very large number of bad effects on the brain and body. I don't know that there's anyone that really debates that anymore. Even if we just agree, and I think we should all agree, on the so-called calories in, calories out principle, right? It's a principle thermodynamics that if we ingest more energy than we burn, we are going to gain weight. If we ingest less energy than we burn, we are generally going to lose weight. And if the two things are in balance, ingestion and burning of energy, well, then we're going to maintain weight. So everyone agrees on that, I agree on that. But beyond, there are a number of ways in which particular nutrients, in the case of today's episode, sugar, impact the way that the brain works, such that we tend to seek out more of particular nutrients. For instance, if we eat sugar, there are two, or at least two mechanisms, by which we will crave more sugar. I think most people are aware of that experience, but today I'm going to explain exactly how that works. But also that when we ingest sugar it has a bunch of different effects on the way that our neural circuits work that can allow us to be more or less focused, more or less agitated, a more or less happy, more or less depressed in some cases. So today, as we explore this thing we're calling sugar, we are going to explore that mainly in the context of the nervous system, but also in the context of how the nervous system regulates many, many functions and behaviors that are important to all of you, your ability to think, your ability to extra size, your ability to gain weight, lose weight, whatever your goals might happen to be, sugar plays a critical role in achieving those goals. And in some cases, if you're ingesting too much at the wrong times or the wrong forms, sugar can actually impede those goals. In fact, sugar can prevent all the right behaviors from allowing you to achieve the goals that you want. So today we are going to place sugar into its proper context. The way I want to start off by doing that is to tell you a little bit of what happens when we eat and a little bit of what the brain does to respond to those events.",

                "transcript": "to respond to those events. So what happens when we eat? Well, I've done an entire episode on metabolism. So if you're interested in the full cascade of hormonal and neural events that occurs when we eat, please check out that episode. But for the sake of today's discussion, let's just take a, what I call top contour view of the hormonal response to ingesting food. Now, anytime we eat, that is the consequence of a number of things that happened before we ate. There's a own in our brain body called Ghrelin, spelled G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Ghrelin is a hormone that increases depending on how long it's been since we ate last. So the longer it's been since we had a meal, Ghrelin levels are going to be higher and higher and higher, and it essentially makes us hungry by interacting with particular neurons in an area of the brain called the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and some other areas as well, like the lateral hypothalamus. You don't need to know the names of those brain areas, but if you'd like to know them, there they are Ghrelin increases, it tends to make us hungry. And then when we eat, typically what happens is Ghrelin levels go down. So it's a very logical system. Now, when we eat, assuming that we eat carbohydrates, but even if we just eat some protein and some fats, we will experience a slight, or in some cases, a large rise in blood glucose, blood glucose is simply blood sugar. And the body and brain, we should say in particular, the nervous system doesn't function well if blood sugar is too high or too low. So as a consequence, we have another hormone, which is released from the pancreas, which is called insulin, which helps regulate the amount of glucose in the bloodstream. So even if you were to ingest an entire cup, an eight ounce cup of pure table sugar, which would send your blood glucose very, very high, assuming that you have a normal insulin response, that you're not diabetic, that insulin response would help clamp that blood glucose level so that it did not cause damage to your brain and body. Because if blood sugar goes too high, it's actually toxic to neurons and other cells of your body, it can kill them off. And neurons of the central nervous system, meaning the brain and spinal cord, once they are dead, they do not come back. So your biological systems understand this at a biological level that is, and prevent that death of cells due to high blood sugar, by keeping insulin around, in order to clamp blood glucose. Diabetics, we call them type one diabetics, who don't make insulin, have to take insulin when they eat in particular, when they eat foods that raise their blood sugar, specifically to avoid that neurotoxicity and the other deleterious effects of high blood sugar. So Ghrelin is a hormone that goes up the longer it's been since we've eaten, it tends to stimulate hunger. When we eat, Ghrelin is suppressed. Blood glucose typically goes up, especially when we eat a carbohydrate containing meal. When blood glucose goes up, it's regulated in the body, meaning its peaks and its valleys are more or less smoothed out, and that glucose is sequestered, it's taken away where it needs to be taken away. And in certain locations, it's delivered to cells so that those cells can use the glucose. Now, one of the chief organs for glucose utilization is the brain, neurons are tremendously metabolically active. And their preferred mode of metabolism is glucose metabolism. In other words, neurons basically run on sugar, which is not to say that you should eat a lot of sugar. As you'll see today, there are states of mind and body, for instance, fasted states, in which people report having immense amounts of mental clarity and their blood glucose is actually quite low. So it is simply not the case that the more sugar that you ingest, the better that your brain will function. But it is the case that for most people, meaning people who are not on a ketogenic or very low carbohydrate diet, they're not adapted to low carbohydrate diets, that neurons in their brain and body are using glucose in order to function. That's what allows those neurons to fire electrical potentials, that's how we refer to it, firing, meaning sending electrical signals down their length to communicate with other neurons. To illustrate just how important glucose is for brain function, I'd like to describe a study that just recently came out,",

                "transcript": "I'd like to describe a study that just recently came out, that sits on a long history of similar studies. But the one that just came out is particularly interesting. Now I want to point out that, unless I say otherwise, I'm going to refer to typical diets, meaning I have to believe that most people out there are in ingesting some starch some starch or carbohydrate. I do realize there are people following very low carbohydrate diets or moderately carbohydrate diets. I even know that there's some folks out there who are on the so-called carnivore diet, they only eat meat and organs, maybe a little fruit. But I'm going to assume that the vast majority of people listening ingest proteins and carbohydrates. So unless I say ketogenic, or I emphasize ketosis itself, which I will, I'm referring to a kind of typical diet where people are consuming fats, proteins and carbohydrates. I count myself as one such individual. At some point I might try the carnivore diet, who knows, I might I a pure vegan diet, who knows. But for my entire life up until now, I'm 46 years old, I've been a proud omnivore, meaning I've tried to eat high quality as much as I can, unprocessed foods, I try and really avoid highly processed foods. But I do eat from those three macronutrient groups, proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, and I'm going to assume that most of you do as well. The study I'd like to emphasize, recorded from neurons, nerve cells, in the brain, in particular in the part of the brain `that responds to visual images, the so called visual cortex. And neurons in the visual cortex are beautifully tuned, as we say, to particular features of what we see. The primary example of this, the kind of classic example, is if you put a little electrode next to a neuron in your visual cortex, or if we put you into an FMRI scanner machine, which can detect neural activity, and I were to show you a bunch of just little lines, bars of light, they could be dark bars of light, they could be light bars of light, on a screen in front of you. So some would be vertical, some would be horizontal, some would be at 45 degrees, what we would see is that some neurons respond best, meaning they fire a lot of electrical activity to vertical lines, other ones respond to horizontal lines, and others respond to 45 degree lines. And this so called orientation tuning, meaning because of the orientation of the line, is a cardinal classic feature of the way that your visual system is built. And everything that you see, whether it's a face or a dog or a cat or a landscape, is built up from these very simple neuron responses. In other words, when you look at a face, there are neurons deep in the brain that respond to faces. But the only reason that those neurons can respond to those faces is because they receive signals from neurons in your visual cortex. Some of which respond to vertical lines, some of which respond to horizontal lines, and some which respond to 45 degree lines. And all of those are built up in what we call a hierarchical representation, which just fancy language for those are the building blocks by which you see a face and you recognize a face. And it's really an amazing phenomenon, it happens very, very fast. You never notice that you're doing this, but everything is built up from these fundamental orientation-tuned neurons. Now orientation-tuned neurons are so fundamental that they are the building blocks by which you make up all other things that you see, it's the way you read, it's the way that you recognize faces, as I mentioned, and everything else. Experimentally, it's quite straightforward to measure how sharply tuned one of these neurons is. In other words, if I were to show you a vertical line and find a neuron in your brain that responds to vertical lines, I could also ask whether or not that neuron fires any electrical activity in response to a line that's not quite vertical, maybe just 10 degrees off vertical or 20 degrees or 30 degrees. And what I eventually would find is that that neuron was orientation-tuned over a particular range of angles. It's not only going to respond to vertical lines, it's also going to respond to lines that are about 10 degrees off vertical on either side, but probably not much more, maybe 20, but usually it's going to be anywhere from vertical to just tilted slightly. In the recent experiment that was published in the journal, \"Neuron,\" Cell Press journal, excellent journal, the authors asked a really interesting question, they asked whether or not the sharpness of tuning, the precision of orientation tuning of these neurons is dependent on blood glucose level. So just to cut to the chase, to give you the answer, what they found is that when subjects are well fed, neurons that responded to vertical, responded very strongly to vertical, but not very much at all to other angles, of what we call stimuli, so lines that are 10 degrees or 20 degrees off. If they looked at neurons that were primarily tuned, right, that preferred horizontal lines, they found the same thing. So it wasn't something unique to vertical lines. What they basically found was the sharpness, the precision of tuning of neurons in the brain, was best when subjects were fed. And conversely, when subjects were fasted, the orientation tuning of these neurons became much broader. What it meant was that a neuron that normally would only respond to vertical now responded to other angles of lines as well. You might say, well, that's great, right, these neurons that at one point could only do one thing are now tuned to other things. But it's not so great because what that means is that in the fasted state, your perception of the outside world is actually distorted, it's blurred, it's not as precise as it is when you're fed. And when I say fed, what I really mean is when glucose is available to neurons. Now, for some of you, maybe many of you, and including myself, intermittent fasting, or some variant thereof, is actually a state that I like. It allows me to focus. For instance, as I mentioned before, and even earlier in this podcast, I tend to eat my first meal sometime around 11:00 AM. And then I generally eat my last meal sometime around 8:00 PM, plus or minus an hour on either side, I'm not super strict about it. And occasionally I'll wake up really hungry and I'll eat something before 11:00 AM. I'm not super strict about this intermittent fasting thing. It just seems to be how my appetite works best, given my schedule, et cetera. In the morning, I tend to be most focused. And I always associated that with the fact that I was fasted. I ingest water and some caffeine about 90 minutes after waking up, I drink my caffeine, but I hydrate from the time I get up, et cetera, et cetera. And I know a lot of other people have had the experience of being fasted and feeling like they have a lot of mental clarity. When you are in a fasted state, typically you are going to use fuels that are available to the neurons, based on your intake of food the day before, maybe you're using some glycogen, maybe you're using some fat, maybe you're using some blood sugar, that's derived from other storage sites in the body. You don't actually use fat as a fuel source for neurons under typical conditions. But there are ways in which proteins and fats and glycogen, et cetera, are converted into fuel that neurons can use. What's interesting about this study is that the study says that when well fed, meaning when blood glucose, sugar, is at a properly elevated level in the bloodstream, it can be delivered to the brain in a way that allows neurons to work best, which is really all just to underscore the point that I made earlier, which is that your nervous system is extremely metabolically demanding, and it loves glucose, neurons love glucose. So the takeaway from this study is not that you should avoid fasting, the takeaway from this study is that there are elements of the fasted state in particular the elevations in things like epinephrine and norepinephrine, also called adrenaline and noradrenaline, that can give us this kind of clarity of mind that many people are pursuing when they fast. That's kind of one of the reasons a lot of people fast, they like the way that they feel, mentally and physically. But I think it's only fair to point out that glucose is the preferred source of fuel for the brain. And this study that I mentioned is one of many studies that have explored how nutritional status or blood glucose status in the brain and body influence neuronal tuning and neuronal function. And it really points to the fact that ultimately, your brain as an organ, is a glucose consuming machine. Now, when you eat a food, that food is broken down and if it contains carbohydrates, it's going to be converted into glucose. And that glucose can't get directly into the brain as a fuel source. It actually has to be carried across the so-called blood brain barrier, the BBB, and the actual metabolism of glucose and the delivery of the glucose to the neurons is carried out by a different cell type. And it's a cell type that you should all know about because it's the most abundant cell type in your brain, and maybe even in your entire nervous system, and that's the so-called astrocyte. Astrocytes are one of several types of glia, the word glia means glue. But many people have taken that name, glia, glue, to think that, oh, the only thing that the astrocytes are doing is just kind of holding things together. Actually, the astrocytes are involved in delivering glucose to the neurons, they are critically involved in shaping your neuronal function and brain plasticity, the brain's ability to change in response to experience. So these astrocytes are like the little waiters and waitresses bringing glucose to the neurons and the neurons are going to do the heavy lifting that's involved in perception and behavior and action. So if prior to this episode, you didn't already realize that glucose, blood sugar, is vital to the function of your brain and other neurons of your nervous system, now you know. And for those of you that have experienced the increase in mental clarity that comes after a properly timed, properly composed, meaning it has the right macronutrients in the right ratios, and a properly sized meal, well then now you have justification for eating something as a way to improve the way that your brain works. It turns out that your brain is going to work best when it's got glucose available, whether you like to fast or not, that's just the reality of things. The same thing is also true for the neurons in your body. The way that you are able to move the limbs of your body, the way you are able to perform exercise",

                "transcript": "the way you are able to perform exercise or movement of any kind for that matter, is because as neurons, called motor neurons, send electrical potentials to the muscle fibers, they release a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine, which causes contraction in the muscle fibers, and allows you to move your limbs. Those neurons are also very metabolically demanding, especially when you're doing demanding types of physical work, and that could be cycling or running or weightlifting or yoga or whatever it may be. Those neurons require a ton of glucose. If you've ever had the experience of having to think very hard about how you're generating a movement or force yourself to continue to endure in a given exercise, you might have thought, oh, you know, I'm running out of fuel, that's why I'm getting tired, it's hard to do. That's actually the case sometimes, but that's not always the case. One of the reasons that it feels like work is because your so called upper motor neurons, the ones that control the lower motor neurons in your spinal cord, which control your muscles, they have to be very metabolically active. It's one thing to engage in a reflexive movement where you're just walking around or if you're running continuously. But when you suddenly have to focus on what you're doing, and you have to generate specific patterns of motor movement, well, that feels demanding because one, it increases the release of adrenaline in your brain and body, which makes you feel a little bit agitated and more alert, but also deliberate thought, deliberately controlling the way that your brain and body is moving, requires more glucose uptake, more energy in those very neurons. And this is also why after doing a long about of exercise, you might be tired, but also if you do a about of skill learning of any kind, or if you've been reading and thinking about what you're reading, or if you had a intense conversation with somebody where you're really forcing yourself to listen, and hopefully they're listening to you too, and you're really trying to parse what they're saying, and maybe you're doing that right now, and you're trying to really track something, that's work, and that work requires glucose uptake by neurons, both in the brain and in your body. Now that we've established that glucose",

                "transcript": "Now that we've established that glucose is the preferred source of fuel for the nervous system, I'd like to concentrate on a few of the other types of sugars that we ingest on a common basis, and the impact that those have on brain function and body function. I'd particularly like to focus on fructose. Fructose, of course, is found in fruit, it's also found in the infamous high fructose corn syrup, which we will talk about today. It's worth pointing out that the concentrations of fructose in fruit is quite low compared to the concentrations of fructose in high fructose corn syrup. High fructose corn syrup is approximately 50% fructose, which turns out to be an enormously high percentage of anything, really, especially when we cut contrast that to the concentrations of fructose in fruit. Fruits have other types of sugars in them as well. You know, the sucrose content of most fruit and fruit juices is low. Although there are some fruits like melons, peaches, pineapples, and so forth, that contain a little less than 10% or so of sucrose. Things like mangoES can have a lot of sucrose. But typically the amount of fructose, fructose, I think is the proper pronunciation, people are always correcting me. Fructose is anywhere from 1% to about 10%, right? It's really going to vary quite a bit. And many of you have probably heard of the so-called glycemic index, which is basically a measure of how fast blood sugar rises after eating particular foods, et cetera. We're going to set aside the glycemic index for now, we will come back to it. It has some relationship to the concentrations of fructose in fruit. But the point that I'd like to make is that fructose as a sugar, is handled very differently in the body than is glucose. But I also want to emphasize that because the percentage of fructose in fruit is rather low, especially compared to high fructose corn syrup, many people have demonized fructose saying that fructose makes you fat, or that fruit makes you fat. If you look at the data, that's not really the case. The fact of the matter is that the concentrations of fructose in fruit are so low that unless someone is consuming a lot of fruit, or they're consuming a lot of fruit on the backdrop of a highly processed diet or a diet that has a lot of other stuff that they might not want to be ingesting, you can't really say that fructose is fattening. I don't really think that there's any basis for saying that fructose itself is bad. Now high fructose corn syrup is a different issue, and too much consumption of anything, fructose included, whether or not it comes fruit or otherwise, can be a problem for the ways that it impacts the neural circuits that process sugar, not just glucose, but fructose. And so we'll illustrate those neural circuits in a bit, and it'll become very clear to all of you, regardless of whether or not you have a background in biology or metabolism, nutrition, or otherwise, why ingesting very high concentrations of fructose is not going to be a good thing for the way that your brain functions. One of the key distinctions between glucose and fructose is that fructose most likely cannot directly access the brain. It actually needs to be converted into glucose in the liver. And the way that conversion occurs feeds back to a set of hormones and neural pathways that we talked about earlier, which have a lot to do with appetite. And to just summarize what is now a lot of very solid data, fructose and specifically fructose, has the ability to reduce certain hormones and peptides in our body whose main job is to suppress Ghrelin. As you recall, Ghrelin is a hormone that increases the longer it's been since we've eaten, and Ghrelin makes us hungry by stimulating particular neurons in our hypothalamus, it actually makes us really want to eat. And in particular, really makes us want to eat sugary and fatty foods. Fructose reduces the activity of the hormones that reduce Ghrelin . And so the net consequence of that is that fructose increases Ghrelin. So, although I and I think pretty much everyone out there, say for a few individuals, agrees that calories in and calories out is the fundamental principle of weight loss, weight maintenance or weight gain. Ingesting fructose shifts our hormone system, and as a consequence, our neural pathways within our brain, the hypothalamus, to be hungrier regardless of how many calories we've eaten. Now I also want to be absolutely clear, this does not mean that eating an apple or eating a melon or eating a couple of apricots or something is going to make you hyperphagic, meaning it's going to make you just want to eat, eat, and eat, that's simply not the case. But if you compare fructose and you compare glucose, not only are they metabolized differently in the brain and body, but in addition to that, fructose has this impact of reducing the hormones that reduce hunger hormones in neural circuits. And so fructose does have this kind of twist in its phenotype, right? Or I guess if fructose had a dating profile, this would be a kind of a red flag in that profile, because fructose itself, while it's actually a pretty good fuel source in many ways, and it's often packaged in things like fruits, which bring along fiber and vitamins and minerals, that I think for many of us are things that we should be eating more of and ingesting more of, it can suppress the pathways that suppress hunger. And as a consequence, it can increase hunger. So current recommendations for most people are to eat more fruits and vegetables. But for those of you that are trying to control your hunger, ingesting a lot of fruit to is probably not going to be a good idea. Certainly, ingesting it from high fructose corn syrup is not going to be a good idea because of the enormous percentages of fructose in high fructose corn syrup, 50%, or sometimes even more. But even from fruit, some people will find that fruit really quenches their appetite. Other people will find that fruit stimulates their appetite. And I suppose if you're trying to stimulate your appetite, then ingesting more fruit might actually be advantageous to you. So fructose provides a bridge for us between a particular kind of sugar, hormone function, in this case Ghrelin and the hypothalamus. which leads us to the next question, which is what is it about sugar",

                "transcript": "which is what is it about sugar that makes it such an attractive thing for us? Why do we like it so much? And the obvious answer that most people arrive at is, well, it just tastes really, really good. But that's actually not the way it works. The rewarding property is as we say of sugar, whether or not they come in the form of sucrose or fructose or foods that increase glucose to a very high level, actually is not just related to the taste of the foods that produce that elevation in glucose, sucrose, or fructose. It is in part, but that's only part of the story, and the rest of the story, once you understand it, can actually place you in a position to much better control your sugar intake of all kinds, but also your food intake in ways that can allow you to make much better choices about the foods you ingest. And actually at this point, I should probably give a confession, I've said today, and I'll say it again, and I've said it I'm pretty podcast. I don't have much of a sweet tooth and indeed that's true. And I can kind of pass on chocolate or ice cream or things like that, it seems like with each successive year, sweet things are less and less appealing to me. Of course, savory foods, anything that is really fatty, salty, savory, those don't last long in my presence, but I always say, I don't really like sweet things so much, and I like sweet people, but I don't tend to like sweet foods, which is true. But there's probably one exception and that's mangoes. And it turns out that mangoes have the highest percentage of sugar in them, in particular fructose, as well as other forms of sugars. So what I do, because I love mango so much, is I will have mangoes probably twice a week, but I'll have them after some sort of resistance training or hard run or something like that. Because it is the case that after you exercise hard, in particular exercise that is of the high intensity variety, that your body is more efficient at using circulating sugar. It's able to store that or use that for fuel. And so what I'll typically do is just take the mango, I actually eat the peels too. I know there probably some people are going to cringe when they hear that, I find them delicious. So I'll just bite into those things like apples, I don't eat the pits, however. So now I want to take us on a journey into the nervous system to explain, the pathways in the brain and body that regulate our appetite for sugar.",

                "transcript": "that regulate our appetite for sugar. Now, keep in mind what I already told you before, which is that when we ingest foods, they're broken down into various components and glucose is going to be shuttled to the brain, and of course, to other neurons in our spinal cord and elsewhere, and to our muscles, cetera, in order for all of those cells and organs and tissues is to be able to function. The fact that so many cells and organs and tissues require glucose in order to function has led to a situation where you have dedicated neural machinery, pieces of your brain, that are almost entirely, if not entirely devoted, to seeking out of sugar or foods that contain sugars. And to make sure that you not only seek those out, but you know where those foods are and that you ingest more and more and more of them. And there are two main ways that these neural circuits work. In fact, we can see that there are two neural circuits entirely that work in parallel. And this is a common theme throughout the nervous system, and that's parallel pathways. Parallel pathways are the ways that you can distinguish light from dark, parallel pathways are the ways that you can distinguish high pitched sounds from low pitched sounds, parallel pathways are the ways that you can flex your muscles versus extend your muscles. For instance, if you move your wrist closer to your shoulder, you're flexing your bicep and you're actually inhibiting, you're actually preventing the action of your tricep. If you move your wrist away from your shoulder, you are essentially using your extensor, your tricep, and you're inhibiting the activity of your bicep. So for every function in your body that you might think is controlled by one brain area or one neural circuit, almost always there are two or more so called parallel pathways that ensure that that particular behavior happens. Now, in the case of sugar consumption, the two parallel pathways involve one pathway related to the actual taste and the perception of taste that lead, not just you, but every animal that we're aware of, to seek more sweet containing foods. The other parallel pathway is related to the nutritive component of sweet foods. Meaning the degree to which a given food will raise blood glucose. I want to repeat that. One pathway in your brain and body is devoted to getting you to seek out sweet tasting things that you perceive as sweet, and another parallel pathway is devoted to getting you to seek out foods that lead to increases in blood glucose. It just so happens that the foods that lead to big increases in blood glucose typically are associated with that sweet taste. Now, this is distinctly different than the neural pathways that control seeking of savory foods or salty foods or spicy foods, for that matter, or bitter foods. The sweet pathway is what we would call hardwired. It exists, as far as we know, in every mammal, it even exists in fruit flies, hence fruit fly. Basically getting sweet stuff into the body might seem like it has a lot to do with the taste, but it has just as much to do with the nutritive components that sweet tasting foods carry, and the fact that your nervous system and so many cells in your brain and body run on glucose. If you recall earlier, I said, even if you ingest fructose, fructose can be converted into glucose in the liver. And I mentioned, of course, that fructose may actually work directly on the brain, that's still unclear for humans, the jury's still out on that, we will see. But the fundamental thing to understand here is that when you think you want a piece of chocolate or you think you want a piece of cake or you're craving something sweet, you are both craving the taste and your neurons are literally craving the nutritive components that arrive with that taste. And simply by understanding that can allow you to circumvent some of the sugar cravings that you might otherwise be a complete hopeless victim to. Also in this episode, I will talk about ways that you can sort of undermine or short circuit these circuits, if you will, in order to reduce sugar cravings on a regular basis, if that's your goal. Two parallel pathways, one of the parallel pathways has to do with conscious perception. So animals of all kinds of mice, rats and humans, will prefer sugary taste to non-sugary taste. When we eat something that tastes sweet, we register that sweet taste by way of sweet receptors, literally little ports or portals of neurons on our tongue and on our pallet, a lot of people don't realize this, but there are a lot of taste receptors on the soft pallet and around the mouth, on the sides of the mouth. So you're actually tasting things, not just with your tongue, but with your entire mouth and your pallet. So when you ingest something sweet, very quickly there are signals sent from those neurons in your mouth to brain areas that cause you to seek out or at least pay attention to, the source and the abundance of those sweet things. They literally change your perception. In fact, there are beautiful neuroimaging studies that show that when people ingest a sugary drink, their perception of images of foods change very much to make those foods appear more appetizing, and not just foods that contain sugar. Results of those studies do show that there's an increase for instance, in the perception of detail and images of ice cream, after you ingest a sweet drink or even if you put like a hard candy into your mouth, it will make you seek out sugary things more, it will make sugary things look more appetizing, but also other foods, more appetizing. So I think it's important that people recognize that fact, that when you have a sweet taste in your mouth or when you've tasted something sweet within your mouth, I should say, your perception of has immediately shifted. These are fast neural pathways. We'll get into some of the brain structures in a moment, but these are fast neural pathways that shift your entire self toward seeking more sugary stuff and more food generally. Now, does that mean that you should never ingest anything sweet? No, certainly I'm not saying that, everyone has to decide for themselves what the appropriate amount of sugar intake is, but I find it remarkable when people say, oh, you know, I need to get my sugar fix, or I need to have my chocolate, or I need to have a little bit of something to just kind of take care of that sugar appetite. Because in taking care of that sugar appetite, maybe for the very disciplined of you, you can just have that one piece of chocolate and it's great, and you can relish in it, but it does shift the way that you perceive other foods as well. And the way it does that is through our,",

                "desc": "Tool: Sugar & the Dopamine, Pleasure – Pain Dichotomy",
                "transcript": "And the way it does that is through our, probably if you're listener this podcast, now old friend, but incredible neuro modulator, dopamine. Dopamine is a molecule that is released from several places in the brain. There's a so-called mesolimbic reward pathway, which is a whole set of places in the brain or circuits, designed to get us motivated and craving and in pursuit of things. And then of course there are areas of the brain that are involved in movement that are linked up with those areas involved in motivation. That makes perfect sense. Why would you have a brain area involved in motivation if you couldn't actually do something with that motivation? So the way that your brain is designed is when there's an increase in dopamine, in the mesolimbic reward pathway, there are signals sent to an area of the brain called the striatum, we're going to spend a little bit of time today in the striatum. It's got a dorsal part, meaning in an upper part and a ventral part, which means a lower part. And the dopamine sent to those area, places us, excuse me, into modes of action, to pursue particular things. Sugar or sweet tastes, I should say, to be more specific, have an incredibly potent ability to activate dopamine release within the mesolimbic reward pathway. This has been shown over and over and over again in animal models and in humans. This is especially true, I should mention, through the ingestion of sweet liquids. Now this becomes a very important point to us a little later on when we talk about the proliferation of sodas and sweet drinks, and dare I even say, non-sugar or diet sodas, we're going to get into that a little bit later. They are perhaps one of the most third rail topics in nutrition. But when we ingest something sweet, the perception of that sweet taste increases dopamine in the mesolimbic reward pathways, which then are conveyed to pathways for motor behavior, and in general, place us into modes of focused action toward getting more of whatever was sweet. Again, for those of you that are very disciplined, you can probably eat that one piece of chocolate and be just fine. But if you understand the way that dopamine works, what you'll realize is that when this dopamine pathway is triggered, it tends to create not the sensation or the perception of satiety, of feeling like something is enough, but rather to produce the sensation of wanting more. As described in the episode that I hosted with my phenomenal colleague from Stanford School of Medicine, Dr. Anna Lembke, she's an expert on addiction and dopamine pathways, the dopamine circuits of the brain have what we call a pleasure pain balance. And there I'm paraphrasing what Dr. Anna Lembke has said, and has written about in her beautiful book, \"Dopamine Nation.\" If you haven't read that book, I highly recommend it. Whether or not you have issues with addiction or you know people that do, or you don't, it's an incredibly important read, especially if you're interested in understanding motivated behaviors and ways to channel your behaviors in life toward healthy, motivated behaviors, and make sure that you avoid some of the common pitfalls that people fall into, not just addiction, but things like overuse of social media or wasting time in general, it's a phenomenal book. In that book, and of course, within research articles, you will find evidence of this so-called pleasure pain balance that exists within our dopamine circuits. Nobody has dopamine circuits that allow them to escape this pleasure pain balance. And the way this works is that anytime that we engage in a behavior or we ingest something that increases our levels of dopamine, there is a subsequent increase in the neural circuits that control our sense of frustration, pain, and lack. You can actually notice this phenomenon if, for instance, you're somebody who really likes chocolate, or you really like something else, pay attention to the way that you experience indulging in that thing. If you eat that piece of chocolate and you really focus on savoring its amazing taste, you'll notice that it provides some quenching of your desire for let's say sweet stuff or chocolate or both, but right as you stop experiencing that, right as that chocolate intake tapers off, as you swallow it down your throat, or you just pause for a second afterwards, what you'll notice is that your brain and body actually orient toward wanting more. And that wanting of more is really the action of the neural circuits that underlie pain and are pushing your dopamine levels back down. And when these circuits go awry or I should say, when people fail to who control themselves within the context of that pleasure pain balance, the typical behavior is to reach for yet another chocolate or to then look for something that will quench that desire and get dopamine levels back up. Now the way these pleasure pain circuits work is very diabolical. Because it turns out that were you to take another piece of chocolate, yes, your dopamine levels would go back up, but not to the same extent that they did the first bite of chocolate that you had. In fact, we can say that the longer it's been since you've indulged in something that you really enjoy or would like, the greater the dopamine you will experience when you finally engage in that behavior or indulge to that thing, ingest that thing, and the greater the dopamine increase, the greater the subsequent action of those pain circuits. So this puts you on a very complicated seesaw. It's a very wobbly precarious state to be in. Which is not to say you shouldn't have a piece of chocolate, it's just to say that the sweet taste of sweet things in particular, things that we crave very much and we wait and wait and wait, and then we allow ourselves to indulge. Those trigger changes in our neurochemistry, in our neuro circuits, that place us in a very vulnerable place, to either want more and more of that thing or to seek out other ways to fill that kind of emptiness that we feel or that gap, like, oh, I would love more, but I'm not going to allow myself more. Now again, I'm not saying that you shouldn't pursue pleasurable things. I mean this molecule dopamine exists for a reason. Frankly, because of its involvement in sex and reproduction, it's the reason we're all here in the first place. Because last time I checked, the only way any of us got here was one way or another, sperm met egg and there was conception. I still believe there are no exceptions to that, that I'm aware of anyways, that is a process, or I should say, the events leading up to that process typically involve dopamine in one way or another. There are exceptions to that too, but you get the idea. These dopamine pathways are not evil, they're not bad, but once you understand the way they work, you can leverage them to your advantage as opposed to them leveraging you to their advantage. So when you ingest something sweet,",

                "transcript": "So when you ingest something sweet, you perceive that sweet taste and a cascade ensues within your brain that makes you want more of the sweet thing. That's the conscious pathway for sugar perception, for sweet perception. Now there's the second pathway, the second pathway is what's called the post-ingestive reinforcing properties of sugar, which is really just a fancy nerd speak way of saying there are events that happen within your stomach and below your conscious detection, that are also driving you to seek out sweet tasting things, independent of their taste, and foods that increase blood glucose, independent of their taste. In order to illustrate the immense power of these subconscious circuits for sugar seeking, I'd like to describe an experiment. And this is just one experiment of many, of dozens or more experiments done in animal models and humans, which essentially illustrate the same thing. And as I describe this experiment, I think you will come to understand the power of these circuits. I'll provide a link to this study in the caption. The first author is Freeman. The paper was published in Frontiers in Bioscience, but there have been others, papers in Nature Neuroscience, papers in Neuron, Cell Press journals, et cetera, many, many journals, many, many papers. If subjects are given the choice of drinking plain water or a sweet tasting fluid, their preference for the sweet tasting fluid is much, much higher, right? Sweet tastes better than plain water, at least for most people and certainly for animals. Now, if, for instance, you take an animal which completely lacks sweet receptors, and you can do this through some molecular genetic tools and gymnastics in the laboratory, we call these knockout mice, where you can knock out a particular receptor for sweet taste, you can confirm that there's no perception of sweet things or at least no preference for sweet things in those animals. In humans, you can numb the mouth, there are other pharmacologic ways that you can eliminate sweet receptors in the mouth. And by doing that, you people will tell you, no, I can't taste anything sweet. You could give them a ice cream, you could give them pure sucrose, you could give them table sugar, and they wouldn't be able to perceive it as sweet. If you eliminate the perception of sweet taste in the mouth and you offer people or laboratory animals, water versus some sugar containing solution, you eliminate the preference for the sugary solution. Which tells us that the perception of sweet is important for the preference for sweet tasting drink. This is also true for sweet tasting foods, I should mention. However, in both animal models and in humans, after about 15 minutes, subjects start preferring the sugary water, even though they can't taste that it is sweeter. So to repeat that, if you eliminate the ability to sense sweet, to perceive sweetness in foods, then you eliminate the preference for sweet beverages or sweet foods. So that's not surprising. But if you wait about 15 minutes, the preference for the sweet beverage or the sweet food comes back. Now that doesn't mean that they can perceive the sweetness. In fact, the way these experiments are done is very clever. You offer people various cups of different things or different food items. And then you just look at what they eat more of or what they prefer to eat more of. So this experiment is so crucial because what it says is that the preference for sugar containing foods is in part due to the sweetness of those foods, but in part due to something else. And this something else is what we call the post-ingestive effect, and as I mentioned before, it took about 15 minutes. And you've actually experienced this, whether you realize it or not, this phenomenon of post-ingestive rewarding properties of sweet foods, meaning what happens in your body when you ingest something that increases your blood glucose very much, has no doubt controlled you from the inside, below your awareness, this was happening to you and you didn't realize it. And here's how it works. We all have neurons within our gut. These neurons have a name, they're called neuropod cells. Neuropod cells were famously discovered by Professor, Dr. Diego Bohorquez at Duke University. And these cells respond to, among other things, to the presence of sugar within the gut. So when we ingest a sugary food or drink, or we ingest a food or drink that simply contains fructose, sucrose, glucose, or some other form of sugar that later, through metabolism, will be converted into glucose, the neuropod cells are able to register the presence of those sweet or glucose stimulating foods. And in response to that, send electrical signals, because electrical signals are the way neurons communicate, up to the brain, via the so-called vagus nerve. The vagus nerve, of course, being a nerve pathway, famous for its role in relaxation. That's kind of the assumption out there, that it's always involved in relaxation, that's not the case. It's involved in a lot of things besides relaxation. But nonetheless, these neuropod cells send electrical signals through a particular highway within the vagus to the so-called nodose ganglion, and this is a cluster, a ganglion is just a cluster of neurons. And then the nodose ganglion sends on information to the nucleus of the solitary tract. The nucleus of the solitary tract is an area of the brain that we're going to talk about extensively today. It's very important for understanding sugar preference. These neuropod cells also trigger activation of dopamine pathways within the mesolimbic reward pathway. In other words, there are signals conveyed from the gut, meaning stomach and intestines, to the brain anytime we ingest sweet foods, but it has nothing to do with our perception of them being sweet, it has everything to do with the fact that sweetness of food is almost always correlated with an ability to increase blood glucose. And the net effect of this is a parallel pathway by which dopamine is increased further. Now, the experiment that I described before of animals or humans ingesting something that contains sugar, but not being able to perceive its sweetness, and yet, after a period of time, still preferring that food or drink to non-sugar containing food or drinks, even though they can't distinguish their taste, is dependent on these neuropod cells and related pathways. What this may for you is that anytime you eat something sweet, that substance is actually causing your gut, your stomach and your intestine, or to be more precise, I should say, that substance, food substance, is causing the neuropod cells in your stomach and intestines to send a parallel set of signals up to your brain saying, eat more of that, or simply eat more, eat more, eat more, and preferably eat more sweet foods. So we've all heard of hidden sugars, meaning the sugars that manufacturers have put into foods and disguised them with other flavors. I talked about this in the episode on salt, using salt to mask the taste of sweetness so that people ingest more sugar. That is not an accident that hidden sugars are often hidden with salt or with other flavors. It's done so that people will, meaning you or me, will want to ingest more of a particular food, independent of how sweet that food tastes. And in fact, some crackers, for instance, chips for instance, you might think, oh, well, you know, chips, they're not sweet, they're salty and savory. And again, I'll mention, I love salty and savory foods, including certain foods, I love kettle chips, for instance, I try not to walk by them in the grocery store. I usually have to eat one bag while I'm in the store, and then another later. The savory foods are often laden with these hidden sugars that we can't register as sweetness, but trigger the neuropod cells, which then further trigger dopamine, which make us want more of them. Now we may be able to resist eating more of them, but it makes us crave more food in general. Now we will talk about ways to regulate this pathway, to sort of intervene in this subconscious pathway. But for now I'm hoping that just the understanding that we all have this pathway, this is hardwired into our body, could potentially allow people to better understand why is it that their cravings are so intense, that it's not necessarily just about the taste of that food. And when you consider this in concert with the fact that we have this dopamine pain pleasure balance, excuse me, that I referred to earlier, you start to realize that there are multiple mechanisms hardwired into us, that make it especially hard to not eat the sweet thing or to not eat the food that we're craving. And indeed, that's the case. We have two major accelerators. It's like a car with two accelerators, and we will talk about the brakes, but two ways that really get us into forward motion toward pursuing the consumption of sweet foods. Now, if it doesn't already seem diabolical enough, that sweet things that we perceive as sweet,",

And that has to do with how sugar is metabolized in the brain. Or I should say how glucose is used. Without getting into too much detail, some of the more beautiful studies of neuroimaging and evaluating which brain areas are active when we eat certain foods were done by Dr. Dana Small's lab at Yale University, and in some of her previous work when she was elsewhere, and of course by other laboratories too. And they used an approach called positron emission tomography, and they and others have used PET scanning as it's called, positron mission tomography, along with an tool called 2-Deoxy-D-glucose. 2-Deoxy-D-glucose is actually involved in the procedure of seeing which brain areas are active when people eat foods or engage in other types of behaviors. But the way that 2-Deoxy-D-glucose, sometimes shortened 2DG. The way that it works is to block glucose uptake from neurons. And instead, bring along with it, a marker that one can see through imaging. So in other words, a tool for looking at what parts of the brain are active when eating particular foods, actually prevents foods such as sugar, from allowing glucose to get into particular neurons. Now that might seem like a bad situation, you'd say, well, wait, you're trying to understand how sugar works in the brain, and then you block the ability for sugar, glucose, to bind to, or be used by these neurons, because of the thing that you're using for the experiment. Exactly, it's a huge problem, but it turns out to be a huge problem that led to a great insight. And the great insight is this, the preference for sweet tasting foods and liquids is actually blocked by 2-Deoxy-D-glucose. What that means, experimentally, but also in terms of what it means for you and me in the real world, is that there's yet a third parallel pathway that's related to the use of blood sugar, the use of glucose by neurons, that further reinforces our desire to eat more sweet things. And the preference for sweet foods can actually be eliminated through 2-Deoxy-D-glucose. Now I am definitely don't want people going out and consuming 2-Deoxy-D-glucose. This is a laboratory tool, it is not something that you should be ingesting. So don't go look it up and try and get some, there might be other uses for it, but that's not the point. The point is that it is the sweet taste of sugary foods. It is the signals coming from your gut, from your digestive tract to your brain, and it's the use of the metabolic consequences of sugary foods that are acting as a three pronged push on your desire to consume more sugary foods. So this car analogy that I used before, where it's some weird car that has two accelerators, it actually has three accelerators. And so with three accelerators, all pushing the system hard, we can say, wow, there must be something really special about this pathway. And indeed there is, this pathway is the quickest source of fuel for the brain and the rest of the nervous system, it's the source of fuel for the brain and nervous system. And I realize, as I say that all the ketonistas are probably going no, actually ketones are the preferred source. Okay, i acknowledge that there are conditions under which you can bring your blood glucose very low, and there are reasons to do that. Actually ketosis has been a terrifically successful treatment for a lot of forms of epilepsy, in particular, pediatric epilepsy. Many people do derive benefit from ketogenic diets, so I'm not knocking ketogenic diets, but if you were to look at what neurons normally prefer, meaning in a typical diet regimen, it would be glucose. And the fact that fructose is eventually converted to glucose, the fact that when we ingest sucrose, it's eventually converted into a fuel that neurons can use, that's very much in the glucose pathway, what you basically arrive at is the fact that your nervous system is a glucose consuming machine. And you've got at least three pathways, of which I've described, that are pushing on your brain consciously and subconsciously to get you to seek and consume more sugar. Now that all sounds like a pretty depressing picture, at least for those of you that are trying to reduce your sugar intake. And of course we can all reduce sugar intake by way of sheer will, we can not have those foods at home, we can restrict ourselves from those. But there are some things that we all can and perhaps should do in order to regulate these pathways",

And of course they are us and we are them, so this gets into all sorts of issues of consciousness and freewill that I certainly don't want to cover in this episode. But nonetheless, I think once you understand that these circuits exist and you understand that there are simple substitutions and modifications that one can make to their food intake that can work within these pathways and even bypass some of these pathways, you start to realize that you have a lot more control over sugar intake and sugar appetite than you previously thought. Now, many of you have heard of the so-called glycemic index. The glycemic index is a measure of how quickly blood sugar rises after ingesting particular foods. And very broadly speaking, we can say that there are low glycemic index foods, of less than 55, typically, is the measurement, or medium glycemic index foods, which go from about 55 to 69, and then so called high glycemic foods, which are above 70. And of course there's additional nuance related to glycemic load and many more features of the glycemic index. A couple of things to understand about how the glycemic index is measured. And then I'd like to just briefly talk about how the glycemic index can be leveraged to short circuit some of the neural circuits that would otherwise lead us to crave and perhaps even ingest sugar foods. First of all, measurements of glycemic indices of food are typically made by having people ingest those foods in isolation. And in general, we can say that anytime we ingest fiber and/or fat, lipids, along with a particular food, it will reduce the glycemic index of that particular food, either the absolute level of blood glucose that a particular food causes or the rate at which that elevation in blood glucose occurs. And this is why there are some seemingly paradoxical aspects to sweet stuff in terms of the glycemic index. For instance, Ice cream has a lower glycemic index, provided its ice cream that includes fat, which I hope it would, 'cause that's the good tasting ice cream, in my opinion, compared to something like mangoes or table sugar, right? So the glycemic index is not something to hold holy, in most cases, because most people are not ingesting foods in isolation. And there's actually a lot of argument as to whether or not the glycemic index is really as vital as some people claim. There's also the context in which you ingest particular foods. As I mentioned earlier, after I do hard training of any kind, meaning training that ought to deplete glycogen, so hard resistance training, I actually make it a point to ingest some very sweet high glycemic foods like a mango, I'll also ingest some starches 'cause I'm trying to replenish glycogen. I'm also trying to spike my blood sugar a little bit because that can be advantageous in terms of certain strength and hypertrophy protocols, et cetera. But most of the time I'm avoiding these high glycemic foods and high sugar foods, I should point that out. Now, why am I telling you about the glycemic index? Well, if we zoom out and take our perspective on all of this discussion about the glycemic index, through the lens of the nervous system, and we remind ourselves that neurons prefer glucose for energy and that all sweet things, or things that we perceive as sweet, but also sweet things that are ingested and registered by those neuropod cells in our gut trigger the release of dopamine and trigger these neural circuits to make us want to eat more of these foods, what we start to realize is that a sharp rise in blood glucose or a very high degree of elevation in blood glucose, is going to be a much more potent signal than would a more moderate rise in blood glucose or a slower rise in blood glucose. So if we think about the analogy of three accelerators, meaning three parallel neural circuits, all essentially there to get us to seek out and consume more sweet tasting and sugary foods, well then the glycemic index is sort of our measurement of how hard we are pushing down or how fast we are pushing down on those three accelerators. And so for those of you that are trying to reduce sugar take, and you want to do that through an understanding of how these neural circuits work, and you want to short circuit some of the dopamine release that's caused by ingesting sugary foods. It can be advantageous to ingest sweet foods, either alone or in combination with foods that reduce glycemic index or reduce glycemic load. So that might mean making different food choices. So paying attention to sweet tasting foods that can satisfy sugar cravings, but do not have as steep or I should say, do not cause as steep a rise in blood sugar, or it could mean consuming other foods along with sweet foods in order to reduce the glycemic index and thereby, slow or blunt the release of dopamine. You might think, well, why would I want to do that? I want the maximum dopamine output in response to a given sweet food. I don't just want the you know, level 10. I want the level 100 output of dopamine. But you really don't, because of the pleasure pain balance that dopamine causes. And in fact, if we consider some of the non-food substances that really push hard on these dopamine pathways, we can come up with a somewhat sinister, but nonetheless appropriate analogy. The drug, cocaine, causes very robust, potent increases in dopamine within the brain, and typically causes people to want to ingest more cocaine because of those sharp increases in dopamine. But within the category of the drug cocaine, there are various modes of ingestion. Some people inhale it, some people will inject it intravenously, some people will smoke it, and those different forms of taking cocaine actually impact the dopamine circuits differently. And it turns out that crack cocaine, the smokable form of cocaine rock, increases dopamine to a very high degree, but also very quickly. And it is the sharp rise in dopamine over time, not so much the absolute level of dopamine, that makes crack cocaine so absolutely addictive. So sometimes you'll hear, you know, sugar is like crack, well, and that's getting a little extreme because even though I don't think the measurements have been done in the same experiment, I think it's reasonable to think that the absolute level of dopamine caused by ingesting sugar, at least for most people, is not going to be as high as the absolute level of dopamine caused by smoking crack. Of course it goes without saying, please don't do cocaine in any form, by the way. It is appropriate to say that the rate of dopamine increase over time has a profound effect on how people will, and if people will, go on to want to pursue more of what caused that increase in dopamine. So what I'm basically saying is if you're going to ingest sweet foods in order to satisfy a sweet craving, ingesting sweet foods for which the glycemic index is lower or in which you've adjusted those glycemic index foods through the co-ingestion of fiber, or maybe fat, might be beneficial. So is this justification for putting peanut butter on that piece of chocolate or for having a of ice cream along with the mango that you're craving? In some sense, yes, however, there's also the issue of how sweet and how delicious something tastes. Highly palatable foods, absolutely delicious foods, trigger that one neural circuit, that one accelerator that we were talking about in terms of our analogy of three accelerators, and the more delicious something tastes within our mouth, the further increase in dopamine. So if you really wanted to adjust your sugar cravings and you really still want to ingest some sugary foods, you probably would better off combining fiber with that sugary or sweet food. Now I do realize that it's somewhat unusual and you probably get some strange stares, if you decided to consume broccoli, for instance, along with your chocolate, or with a another dessert that would otherwise cause a steep increase in blood sugar and has a high glycemic index. But nonetheless, if your goal is to blunt your sugar cravings, what you really need to do is blunt that dopamine increase. So what we're really talking about here is trying to reduce the dopamine signal that is the consequence of ingesting sweet foods. And we're talking about doing that through these different parallel pathways, not just by preventing sweet taste, but also by preventing the post-ingestive effects of sweet foods. And of course the backdrop to all of this is that most of us, again, most of us, not all of us, should probably be ingesting fewer refined sugars. Certainly there are exceptions to that.",

But I think the bulk of data point to the fact that ingesting these highly palatable, certainly highly palatable, highly processed foods, or foods that contain a lot of high fructose corn syrup, can be really deleterious to our health, especially in kids. And I'm not going to cite off a bunch of statistics, you've all heard them before, that you know, for hundreds of years, we ingested, you know, the equivalent of a few cups or pounds of sugar per year. And you know, now people are ingesting hundreds of pounds of sugar per year. The major culprit always seems to be sugary drinks, meaning soft drinks, and I think indeed that's the case. I do want to point out the incredible work of Dr. Robert Lustig, who's a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of California San Francisco, who was really early in the game of voicing the dangers of so-called hidden sugars and highly processed foods, there are other people, of course, now talking about this. His laboratory has done important work showing for instance, that if high fructose corn syrup or even just fructose is replaced with glucose, even if the same number calories is ingested, that there are important meaning significant reductions in type two diabetes, some of the metabolic syndromes associated with high fructose corn syrup and on and on and on. And of course there are other culprits in type two diabetes, there are other factors that are going to lead to obesity. But I think that work from Lustig and others has really illustrated that we should all be trying to reduce our intake of highly refined sugars and high fructose corn syrup. And certainly trying to reduce our intake of very sugary drinks, not just soft drinks, but also fruit juices that contain a lot of sugar. Now, even for people that are of healthy weight and who don't have metabolic syndromes, there may be an additional reason to not want to ingest very sweet foods and highly refined sugars. And this has to do with a new and emerging area of nutrition neuroscience. And I want to point out that these are new data, right, so it's not a lock, the double blind placebo controlled studies in large populations have not been finished. So I want to make sure that that's clear, but I also want to make clear what some of the really exciting data, coming from Dana Small's lab at Yale, and from other laboratories are showing. And this has to do with what's called conditioned taste preference.",

                "transcript": "conditioned taste preference. Using a kind of Pavlovian paradigm, what they do, is they have people, and these studies were done in people, ingest maltodextrin, which increases blood glucose, doesn't have much flavor, but even if it does have a little bit of subtle flavor, the maltodextrin is cloaked by some other flavor. And by cloaking it with that other flavor or pairing it with that other flavor, what they find is that over time, because the maltodextrin increases blood glucose, and they're ingesting a particular flavor along with that maltodextrin, they can then remove the maltodextrin, and the flavor will induce an increase in insulin. The increase in insulin of course, is the consequence of the fact that anytime there's a rise in blood glucose, provided the person isn't diabetic, there's a parallel increase in insulin. Now this is very interesting because what it says is, well at a first pass, it says that we are very Pavlovian in terms of our physiological responses to foods and particular flavors come to be associated with particular patterns of blood glucose increase and hence patterns of insulin increase, because of course, insulin manages glucose in the bloodstream as I mentioned earlier. This also has implications for understanding things like artificial sweeteners. And here I want to highlight that this is still very controversial work, needs more data, but nonetheless, I'd like to share it with you for consideration. The small laboratory has done studies in humans, both in adults and in children, showing that if the flavor of artificial sweeteners is paired with maltodextrin, and then the maltodextrin is removed, that the artificial sweetener taste itself can subsequently increase insulin in the bloodstream. In other words, taking something that increases blood sugar, attaching a flavor experience to that, having children or adults ingest that thing, allows the nervous system to associate that flavor with that increase in blood glucose. But then you can remove the glucose increasing substance, and the flavor alone will increase insulin because insulin typically follows blood glucose. So this is a conditioning effect. Now, the reason these data are controversial is several fold. First of all, the landscape around the discussion around artificial sweeteners is definitely what I would call a barbed wire topic. And I want to preface what I'm about to say next by saying, I actually ingest artificial sweeteners. I will have the occasional diet soda, not every day, maybe I don't know, once or twice a month. I don't particularly like the taste, but I'll do it just 'cause it's around, and I want some caffeine and I like the carbonation if I'm on a plane or something, I do ingest plant-based non-caloric sweeteners. To my knowledge, there have not been high quality studies of plant-based non-caloric sweeteners in the context that I'm referring to here. Nonetheless, these studies show that particular flavors can be conditioned to cause an insulin increase. And the flavor associated with certain artificial sweeteners is included in that category of flavors that can induce insulin, even in the absence of something that can increase blood glucose. Now the simple takeaway from these studies would be the following, and this is actually one interpretation that Dana Small has offered to her data, but she offers other interpretations as well. One of interpretation is that if people are going to ingest artificial sweeteners, and they do that along with foods that very sharply increase blood glucose, then there is the potential, I highlight the potential, for those same artificial sweeteners to increase insulin, even in the absence of food. In other words, let's just draw the scenario out in the real world. You're having a diet soda along with a cheeseburger and fries. You do that every day for lunch, okay? Somewhat extreme example, but natural world example, you do that every day for lunch. And then you just have a diet soda alone. The extreme interpretation of the data that they've collected says, well, that diet soda alone will increase insulin, even though there's no increase in blood glucose because you haven't ingested food with it because you conditioned that taste of artificial sweetener to the experience of a rise in glucose and hence insulin. Now the counter argument to this would be, well, that's a very unusual situation, maltodextrin causes big increases in blood glucose, so that's not really a fair experiment or it's not a natural world experiment. And I think that's a decent assessment. Although I will point out that one of the reasons why this study is so controversial or why these data are so controversial, is that the experiment actually had to be stopped. And particularly the experiment in children had to be stopped because the changes in insulin that were observed early in the study were so detrimental, that the institutional review board, quite appropriately, said, we can't do this to these kids. They're experiencing these odd shifts in insulin that are not healthy for them when they're just ingesting artificial sweeteners in the absence of these glucose increasing foods. So once again, I do ingest artificial sweeteners, I'm not saying that they are dangerous, I'm not saying that they are not dangerous, I'm saying that you have to decide for yourself. In previous episodes, I've highlighted that artificial sweeteners have been shown in studies of animals, that when given in very high doses, sucralose in particular, there can be fairly robust disruption to the gut microbiome, which is vital for immune health and brain health, et cetera, et cetera. But thus far, our knowledge of how artificial sweeteners negatively impacts or positively impacts, I should say, the microbiome and other deleterious effects on the body, has mainly been explored in animal studies. Again, the work by Dana Small has been done in humans. There's some parallel work by others in animal models. I bring it up today to illustrate the following point. Normally we have a pathway that we don't have to condition at all, it's there from birth, whereby ingestion of sweet foods causes increases in dopamine. And there are parallel pathways by which neurons in our gut and elsewhere in our body, trigger further increases in dopamine. There's no need for a conditioned response or to become Pavlovian about this, right? You're hardwired to want to eat sweet things, by at least two and probably three parallel pathways. Now the work from Dana Small's lab and others that have illustrated this conditioned flavor preference, I think beautifully show that any flavor that's associated with a glucose spike or a long sustained increase in glucose can also be conditioned. In other words, the circuits for dopamine that reinforce the desire to eat particular things is not unique to the sugar pathway. And this is one of the reasons I believe, why ingestion of sweet foods doesn't just us to want to eat more sweet foods, I think that is absolutely clear based on animal data and on human data, I think that's robust, it's actually the stuff of textbooks now, but in addition, ingesting sweet foods and/or foods that raise blood glucose, but that we don't perceive as sweet. So for instance, foods with hidden sugars, sugars that have been masked asked by salty or spicy taste, increases our desire for glucose elevating foods and food, generally, I think that's the only logical interpretation of the data that I can arrive at. So for people that struggle with regulating their appetite or with regulating their sugar appetite, I think the understanding of conditioned flavor preference, while a little bit complicated, ought to be useful in trying to navigate reducing sugar cravings and sugar intake. As a segue into tools to control sugar intake,",

                "transcript": "As a segue into tools to control sugar intake, as a means to both regulate sugar intake itself, as well as food intake overall and steer us towards healthier choices. I'd like to talk about some of the special populations out there that might want to be especially wary of having a dysregulated sugar appetite system. And the group I'm referring to specifically are those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or, I should say, and/or, people who have issues with focus and attention, generally. And I think more and more nowadays, I'm hearing that people are having a hard time focusing. This probably has something to do with our interactions with electronic devices. As I always say, if a picture is worth a thousand words, a movie is worth a million pictures, and the fact that we can access so any movies just by scrolling with our thumb, is something that the nervous system has just never contended with before in human history. I'm confident in that. And it's not that it can't deal with it, the question is what's the trade off? What are the consequences of that? So attention and ability to focus is obviously key to success in school, success in relationships, success in the workplace, and success in life. We could probably even go so far as to say one's ability to succeed in anything is proportional to one's ability to focus and then deliberately defocus when the time comes to defocus, right? 'Cause we all need rest and we need to disengage and then reengage, If you look at the sum total of the meta-analysis and the clinical data on ADHD and nutrition, you arrive at a pretty clear answer, which is that sugar consumption, in particular, highly refined sugars, is just not good for people with ADHD or with attentional issues. Now, as I say that, I also want you to recall the earlier study that I referred to, whereby the tuning of neurons in the brain is highly dependent on glucose. So this doesn't mean consuming no glucose is going to be a good idea. It doesn't mean that the ketogenic diet is necessarily the best diet for ADHD. Although there are some people pursuing that and exploring that, and we'll do yet another episode on ADHD at some point that go was a little bit deeper into that, because there's some new data. I did do a very long and fairly extensive episode on ADHD. You're welcome to look that up if you like in our archive, excuse me, in our archive at hubermanlab.com, it's all timestamped. So, you know, because the number of people said, oh, you know, it's an episode on ADHD and you made it two and a half hours long. Yes we did, because we wanted it to be as comprehensive as we could at the time. But it is timestamped, you can just jump to the particular topics of interest and there's short little cassettes there. Now, if you'd like to know upon what I'm basing this statement that sugar consumption and highly refined sugar consumption is potentially bad for ADHD, I'm basing this mainly on the conclusions of a really nice paper, the title of the paper is \"Sugar Consumption, Sugar Sweetened Beverages, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.\" And this is a paper, we'll put a link to this in the caption. This was published in Complementary Therapies in Medicine which is a bit of an atypical journal in some sense. But I really like this meta-analysis. The sum total of this meta-analysis is really that when, especially kids, get beyond four sugary drinks per week, so four sodas of a typical 12 ounce soda, when they get past four 12 ounce sugary sodas, they didn't, as far as I know, look at artificially sweetened sodas. That's when you start to see a shift towards more negative outcomes, more symptoms of existing ADHD. Now where the controversy comes in is whether or not sugar consumption can actually trigger or cause ADHD. And I don't think we can conclude that at all at this time. And this review, if you decide to check it out, review/meta-analysis, I should say, if you decide to check it out, goes into some of the nuance around that. What's also interesting in terms of ADHD and sugar intake, and it probably has relevance to all of us, is that they also cover some of the interesting data showing that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids can actually beneficial for people, in particular kids with ADHD, I've talked before about the utility of omega-3s, that's been shown in various studies that have compared omega-3 fatty acid intake to say prescription antidepressants, like SSRIs, like Prozac, Zoloft, and similar, Fluoxetine, and the results of those studies are pretty clear, at least to me, that provided that one gets at least one gram of EPA, essential fatty acids, so it's not just getting one gram per day, but one or more grams per day of the EPA form of essential fatty acid, can rival some prescription antidepressants and/or decrease the amount of antidepressants that's required to take. Which for a lot of people can be a very useful thing because of the side effect profile of many of those antidepressants. Of course, talk to your psychiatrist, talk to your doctor, but the omega-3s are no doubt powerful. And then of course there's a whole story about omega-3s and heart health. And of course, like anything else, there's some controversy around omega-3s, but I think the data are clear enough to me around mood and cardiovascular health, that certainly I personally ingest them. But as always, I always say, anytime you're going to add or remove anything from your nutrition, supplementation, exercise, or otherwise your lifestyle, definitely consult with a board certified physician. I don't just say that to protect me, I say that to protect you, you are responsible for your health ultimately. So omega-3 supplementation has been shown to be beneficial for ADHD. Why am I talking about this in the context of an episode on sugar and the nervous system? Well, if you remember those neuropod cells, those cells in your gut that respond to sugar and send signals up to the brain to cause the release of dopamine. Well, it turns out that neuropod cells also respond to amino acids and to fatty acids, in particular, essential fatty acids. So these cells that we call neuropod cells, have three jobs. One is to levels of sugar in the gut, the other is to detect levels of amino acids, and to detect levels of particular essential fatty acids, and communicate that information to the brain. And I should point out when I say communicate that information, they're not actually saying, hey, there's amino acids here, or hey, there's sugar here, or, hey, there's essential fatty acids, because the language of these cells is somewhat generic. It's just the firing of electrical potentials. But that's the key point, it's generic and all three or any of those three, sugar, essential fatty acids, or amino acids, will trigger these neurons to signal to the brain to increase dopamine. And it is not coincidental that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation can help ameliorate some of the symptoms of ADHD by way of presumably increasing dopamine in this neuropod to dopamine pathway that we talked about earlier. The whole thing has a very nice logical structure to it. And points to yet again, the immense value of bringing the proper amounts, maybe even supplementing the proper amounts of omega-3 fatty acids and the proper amounts of amino acids into the gut as a way to supplant some of the stimulation of these pathways that would otherwise be caused by sugar. There's actually a version of this where one could say, if you want to reduce sugar cravings, you might consider increasing certain forms of amino acid intake or certain forms of fatty acid intake. So what are some ways that we can reduce our sugar cravings, and ideally ways that we can do that,",

                "transcript": "and ideally ways that we can do that, that also benefit us in other ways, both nutritionally and from the neuroscience standpoint? Well, these neuropod cells that respond to and signal the brain when we ingest sugar, as I mentioned, also respond to amino acids and essential fatty acids. We already talked about the essential fatty acids. I make it a particular point to ingest anywhere from one to three grams, that's grams, of EPA essential fatty acid per day. I make it a point to do that with the ingestion of high quality omega-3s. For me, the simplest way to do that, and I think for most people, the lowest cost way to do that, is to use some liquid form of fish oil or some capsule form of fish oil. You really do have to see how much essential fatty acid in the form of EPA is in those. If you try and do that only through capsules, it can get kind of expensive, depending on which particular brands you use, some have more EPA, some less. You can, of course also do this through foods, you can do this with non fish sources, through things like algae, and there's some other forms, you can look it up online now, plant-based sources of EPAs, you can do this with high quality fish oil. In any case, that does seem at least based on a modest amount, but nonetheless solid literature, to reduce sugar cravings somewhat, but that could easily be by mere replacement of calories. So we don't know yet based on human studies, whether or not the ingestion of those EPAs is specifically activating the neuropod cells, which specifically activates dopamine release and bypasses the need for, or the craving for sugar. We don't know that yet. But logically, it holds up to assume that. The fact that these neuropod cells and I should say other neurons within the gut respond very robustly to the presence of particular amino acids is also a potential lever by which one could reduce sugar cravings. And there's an interesting literature around the amino acid, glutamine, in particular supplementing with the amino acid, glutamine, as it relates to sugar cravings, and certainly as it relates to other aspects of the gut, in particular leaky gut. The use of supplemental glutamine to try and treat leaky gut is not a new phenomenon. There are other approaches too, of course. But there are many people who are experimenting with supplementing with glutamine, several grams per day, often even, you know, five grams distributed through three or four different servings throughout the day as a way to blunt their sugar cravings. Now there has not yet been a large scale clinical trial using glutamine to reduce sugar cravings, but the results of the few studies that I looked at, as well as my understanding of the logic of these neuro circuits, including the neuropod cells, brings us to a conclusion that it makes sense why if there's a population of neurons within our gut, that responds very robustly to the presence of sugar, fatty acids, or amino acids, that the intake of particular amino acids would allow the dopamine pathways that might otherwise be triggered by sugar to be triggered by something like glutamine, which has very few or no calories. And in fact, having talked about this previously, a number of people that I know went out and tried this, now this is of course is what I call anec data, right? This is not a quality peer reviewed study, this is anec data. Many of them have reported back that they actually feel as if their sugar cravings are reduced. I know some people who actually take glutamine and mix it with full fat cream and take it kind of like a shot of full fat cream, which sounds absolutely delicious by the way, glutamine is a little bit chalky, so it's not that great tasting to ingest with sugar. I should mention, if you do try and take this approach of ingesting glutamine to reduce sugar cravings, you want to increase the amount of glutamine that you take somewhat gradually. It can create some gastric distress if you just, you know, I certainly wouldn't take a big table spoon of it, throw it in water and chug it down three times a day. Some of you with very hardy stomachs can probably tolerate that. You know, if you're like my bulldog, which unfortunately passed away, but Costello, I always imagine that if ever we did an autopsy on him, he'd have like a license plate and like a human being in his gut, 'cause it seemed like he could ingest anything with no issues, but of course, many people have kind of sensitive guts. So if you're going to try taking glutamine as a means to reduce sugar cravings, just know that the studies are still ongoing. Some people have achieved benefit. Please also realize that there's an entire literature devoted to the potential hazards of increasing glutamine if you have a preexisting cancer. So if you have cancer or you're cancer prone, I would really discourage you from this approach. And in any case, as always, talk to your doctor. The logic nonetheless is there, why increasing amino acid intake or fatty acid intake might decrease sugar craving. Now there are other ways to reduce sugar craving and there are certainly ways to reduce the sharp rise in blood glucose that can occur",

I'm going to sort of layer up through the ones that you might find in your cupboard, at the grocery store, and then get into some of the more extravagant or I should say, esoteric ones, many of which however can be quite potent. The first of which is simple lemon juice, right, or lime juice. There was an old lore and actually some papers, pointing to the idea that the ingestion of vinegar, either white vinegar or wine vinegar, could somehow blunt blood glucose after the ingestion of sugary foods or the ingestion of a lot of carbohydrate foods, or even just a big meal. Actually, Tim Ferris, I should say the great Tim Ferris, 'cause I do have great respect for the fact that he seems to be about 10 years ahead of everything, both in terms of nutrition and skill learning and things of that sort, many of the things that he predicted in his books, \"The Four Hour Body\" and \"The Four Hour Chef\" actually turned out to be true based on scientific data, some of which only exists in the animal models, but now also some predictions that played out to be true in both the animal models and and the human models. So I think that Tim certainly deserves a hat tip for the fact that he experimented with these methods and reported his experiences with those methods and that now some of them, many of them, have been validated by what I perceive to be quality science. He talked about the fact that, at least in his experiments on himself, the ingestion of vinegar did not seem to blunt blood glucose, and he was using continuous glucose monitors. These incidentally, another example of where Ferris was early to the game and the rest of us are kind of just in his wake. He talked about the use of blood glucose monitors, those, I think at the time were implanted below the skin. Nowadays there are less invasive blood glucose monitors, things like Levels and so forth, and these are actually becoming pretty popular. I've worn one of these before. They're actually pretty informative. I learned for instance, that when I go in the sauna that I experience a sharp rise in blood glucose. And that makes sense because of the dehydration associated with being in the sauna, a lot of sweating, the concentration of sugar in the bloodstream goes up. So there's some other things that certain foods affect my blood glucose one way or another. It's kind of an interesting and fun experiment that some of you might be interested in doing as well. Regardless, there are now data pointing to the fact that lemon juice and lime juice, a couple tablespoons or so, if ingested before, or even during, or even after, consumption of sugary foods, or I should say foods that sharply increase blood glucose or large carbohydrate meals, can actually blunt the blood glucose response. And I did see that when I did my own experiments on myself with a continuous glucose monitor, it was kind of fun to do those experiments. I preferred to do those experiments by eating somewhat larger meals of things that didn't contain a lot of sugar. I saw some big increases in blood glucose in certain instances, and then I would ingest some lemon juice or lime juice, typically mixed in with water. And sure enough, you could see a blunting of the blood glucose response. And of course this was real time, continuous, hence continuous, blood glucose monitoring. So for those of you that are interested in blunting your blood sugar response, certain foods, that's a simple, low cost way to do that, if you want to explore it. I will say, if you are fasting and you already have low blood glucose, and you ingest lemon juice, or I should say some lemon juice and water or lime juice and water, be careful because you can actually become hypoglycemic. For the very same reasons that that lemon juice and lime juice can blunt blood glucose when your blood glucose levels are moderate to high, you can also reduce blood glucose levels even further when blood glucose levels are low. Now that's lemon juice and lime juice there. But we can't say that has to do with acidic things, generally. And just as a side point, many of you have probably seen in the store, so called adjusted pH waters or foods and drinks that are supposed to adjust your pH. Hate to break it to you, but your pH is very tightly regulated throughout your brain and body. You do not want this to change. It is entirely impossible, at least in any safe way, that you would become quote unquote more alkaline by ingesting an alkaline water or something like that. It is true that the pH, your alkalinity and acidity varies in different compartments in your body, that's important. Unless you are hemorrhaging or vomiting, or there's something badly wrong with you, health wise, and you're in a really dire circumstance, you don't want big shifts in your body pH and your body has all sorts of ways of buffering against changes in pH. So I encourage you not to fall on the, or hop on the bandwagon of adjusting pH and becoming less acidic, and that kind of thing. When you ingest lemon juice or lime juice, the mechanism by which it blunts blood glucose is probably twofold. One is probably through the post-ingestive effects of glucose in the gut, meaning the way in which sugars are interacting with neurons and other components of your gut circuitry to impact things like gastric emptying time, to impact things like the firing of those neuropod cells and their signaling to the brain. But almost certainly it has something to do also with the perception of sour taste on the tongue. We didn't go into this too much today, but you, of course, don't just have sweet taste receptors in your mouth, you also have bitter taste receptors, you have salty taste receptors, you have sour taste receptors in your mouth and of course, that means your tongue and palate. And those are interacting. If you ingest a substance that's just sweet or mostly sweet, that causes a certain set of effects on your blood glucose, but also your brain, dopamine, and the other neuro circuits of your brain. If you also ingest something that's sour like lemon juice or lime juice, it adjusts the output of those neural circuits in your brain. So again, where you have a situation where you have two parallel pathways, one that's post-ingestive coming from phenomenon within our gut neurons, but also things like gastric emptying time, the clearance and transfer of food, and the conversion of food into particular nutrients and the circulation of glucose in your bloodstream and how it gets into the brain. But also simply by ingesting something sour, you are changing the way that sweet things impact your brain. And so I think it stands to reason that the lemon juice/lime juice effect is not going to be magic. It's going to have everything to do with the way that ingesting sour foods can adjust the taste. Excuse me, can adjust the neural response to taste of sweet foods. And in fact, we know based on the beautiful work of Charles Zuker at Columbia Medical School, that that's exactly what I happens. They've measured the activity of neurons at various locations in the so-called taste pathways of the brain. And they found that when particular tastes like just sweet or just bitter or just sour evoke certain ensembles of neurons to fire in particular sequences, when sweet and sour are co-ingested, when bitter and sour are co-ingested, you get distinct ensembles, meaning distinct patterns of activity of those neurons. And of course, distinct patterns of downstream activity within the brain and body. So while it is still somewhat mysterious as to how exactly things like lemon juice and lime juice can reduce our blood glucose spikes. When we ingest those with sweet foods or carbohydrate laden foods, or with big meals, you can use this as a tool with the understanding that there's a grounding in the biology of the way these circuits work. Now, some of you have probably heard that cinnamon can be a useful tool for controlling blood sugar. And indeed that's the case.",

                "transcript": "And indeed that's the case. It's very clear that cinnamon can adjust the rate of glucose entry into the stream, possibly by changing the rate of gastric emptying, it might slow the rate of gastric emptying and thereby also reduce the glycemic index of particular foods. So I suppose if I were going to eat a mango, and I hadn't just done a bunch of hard training, I might sprinkle some cinnamon on it here. I always enjoy kind of coming up with new ideas of ways that I can eat foods during these podcasts. In any event, there's some debate out there, if you look online as to whether or not Saigon Cinnamon, Cassia cinnamon, excuse me, or Ceylon cinnamon is best for purposes of blunting blood glucose spikes. But I think the, at least by my read of the data and from what I've found, it doesn't really matter provided it's real cinnamon. And you have to actually look and make sure that it's real cinnamon, because a lot of cinnamon that you buy is not real. I do want to provide a cautionary note about cinnamon however. Cinnamon contains something called coumarin. which can be toxic at high levels. So you don't want to ingest more than about a teaspoon, maybe a teaspoon and a half of cinnamon per day, because you'll start to exceed the threshold at which cinnamon could start to be problematic. But certainly if you're going to have a big meal or a meal that has a lot of sugar in it, or a lot of carbohydrate laden foods, and you don't want an increase in blood glucose, you could put cinnamon in a beverage, you could put cinnamon on food in order to blunt that blood glucose increase, reduce the glycemic index by way of reducing gastric emptying time. Again, just making sure that you don't get out past that one and a half teaspoons per day, 'cause you really don't want to start dealing with any of the toxicity related to coumarin. So we've talked about lemon juice and lime juice and cinnamon, these are kind of commonplace in many kitchens. Then of course we can venture into the more esoteric or I would say the more advanced tools for adjusting sugar intake. And the one that comes to mind is of course Berberine. Berberine is a derivative of tree bark",

                "transcript": "Berberine is a derivative of tree bark and it is a very, very potent substance for reducing blood glucose. So much so that it is on par with Metformin or Glibenclamide, which are prescription drugs specifically used to reduce blood glucose. So using Berberine is a serious step, you should absolutely talk to your doctor about it. I know of a number of people that use it to lower blood glucose when they eat really large meals. I know the number of people that are using it to get to some of the other effects of Metformin that people have discussed, things like activating or tapping into the so-called AMPK pathway, reducing mTOR, these are people that are aiming their activities at increasing longevity, a somewhat controversial approach, still, but I know many people are doing it. It is true that if you ingest Berberine, your blood glucose will plummet. And I point that out because I've actually tried it before, it gave me brutal headaches and I felt really dizzy, and I felt like I couldn't see straight. And actually I couldn't see straight, why did it do that? Well, it made me hypoglycemic. It actually drove my blood glucose down too far. And the reason it did that is that I took Berberine on an empty stomach. I know some people can tolerate it. I would say, be very cautious about ingesting Berberine on an empty stomach, or if you are in a low carbohydrate diet, unless you really know what you're doing and you have a medical professional to kind of guide you through that. If I took Berberine along with a very large meal, that included a lot of carbohydrates, you know, I can recall the days in which Costello and I would eat a couple of pizzas and then we might get ice cream, that kind of thing. Then I felt perfectly fine on even up to 750 milligrams or a gram of Berberine. It has the kind of unique property of making you feel not overwhelmed by the amount of blood glucose increase that you're experiencing from eating a big meal. I don't quite know how else to describe it. It's almost as if you can keep eating and eating and eating, and of course you have to protect your gastric volume. I mean, you only have so much space in your stomach to ingest food. I wasn't using it to gorge on food, I just heard about it, I was interested in experimenting with it. I don't have any chronic blood sugar issues. But again, when I took it on an empty stomach, it made me hypoglycemic on a low carbohydrate intake, hypoglycemic, not a good experience. And again, an experience I think to avoid. But provided there's a lot of glucose in your bloodstream, and certainly if you are of the experimental type or you're trying to regulate blood glucose, Berberine might be a good option. But again, talk to your doctor. It does have some other interesting effects in terms of lowering total cholesterol that are research supported of reducing insulin a little bit. Well, that's not surprising if you reduce blood glucose, you're going to reduce insulin because of course, insulin manages blood glucose in the bloodstream. So I would place Berberine and of course, Metformin and Glibenclamide in the kind of the heavy hitting potent tools for regulating blood glucose. Now, this is an episode, not about sugar per se, but sugar viewed through the lens of the nervous system. And what's interesting about Berberine, Metformin, Glibenclamide and related substances, is that some of the effects are of course on gastric emptying or buffering blood glucose within the bloodstream, et cetera. But there appeared to also be some neural effects of having chronically low glucose or blunting blood glucose through things like Berberine. And some of those neural effects include longstanding changes in the hormonal cascades that are the consequence of having low blood sugar and thereby, changes in the neural circuits that manage blood glucose overall. The simple way of saying this is that by maintaining low to moderate blood glucose, either by not ingesting heavily carbohydrate laden foods. So here I'm speaking to the low carb or the ketogenic types or by blunting blood glucose through things like Metformin or Berberine, even if ingesting carbohydrates, maybe even some sugars, over time, it seems that there's a adjustment, what we call a homeostatic regulation of the neural circuits that control things like sugar craving, and indeed, some people report feeling fewer sugar cravings over time. Now I didn't use Berberine for a very long period of time, I've never used Metformin. I have experienced a somewhat odd but welcome phenomenon of with each progressive year of my life, I have fewer and fewer sugar cravings. Why that is, I don't know. I suspect it might have something to do with my sleep. And I'll talk about that in a few minutes. But if you're going to explore Berberine or Metformin or otherwise, in addition to working with a doctor, I think you should understand why you're doing it, right. I think that many of the effects can be quite potent. They can happen in both the immediate term in terms of regulating blood glucose, they can send you hypoglycemic if you aren't careful, they can also cause longstanding changes to the neural circuitry that regulates blood sugar over time. Some of which might be welcome changes, right? Reduce sugar cravings for instance. And if you are really, really serious about modulating blood glucose through things like Berberine, the typical dose range, again, is anywhere from half a gram to 1.5 grams daily, that's the typical dosages that have been explored. And there are some other substances like sodium caprate which are known to augment the effects of Berberine via the AMPK pathways. They basically can increase the ability for Berberine to have its glucose lowering actions. But that of course is getting into the really potent, what I would call sharp blade tools for controlling blood glucose. And listen, anytime you're dealing with blood glucose, you are dealing with the brain's preferred source of fuel. And anytime you're dealing with the brain's preferred source of fuel, you have to be especially cautious about depriving the brain of what it needs. So whether or not you're low carb, high carb, you know, keto, vegan, carnivore, these substances, like Berberine, are very, very potent and you need to take them seriously. There is yet another tool for controlling sugar cravings and the neural circuits that regulate sugar craving and its downstream consequences.",

                "transcript": "and its downstream consequences. And this tool is what I would call a high performance tool, but it's one that you probably didn't suspect and that's sleep. I've done extensive episodes about sleep, and we actually have an episode called master your sleep. You can find that episode easily at hubermanlab.com. It's available in all the various formats, YouTube, Apple, Spotify, et cetera. and it provides a lot of tools. And on social media, I provide a lot of tools, often we have a newsletter that provides tools on how to maximize sleep. What is the role of sleep in sugar metabolism, sugar, hunger, and the way that the brain regulates those things? Well, there's a really exciting study that came out just last year. This study was published in the journal, Cell Report, a Cell Press journal, excellent journal. And the reason I love this study so much, is it involved having people, so yes, this was done in humans, sleep in the laboratory. That's not unusual, there's a sleep lab at Stanford, there's sleep labs elsewhere. But what they did was they actually measured from the breath of these people, and they extracted from their breath, the metabolites that would allow them to understand what sorts of metabolism was occurring in these people's bodies at different phases of sleep. And this is a really remarkable study. They actually did this every 10 seconds throughout the entire night. So in little tiny 10 second bits, meaning at very high resolution, they could evaluate what is the metabolism in the brain and body that people experience as they go from REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep to slow wave, sleep, and so on. And I'll go deeper into the study again in the future, because it's so interesting, and I think so important. But what they discovered was that each stage of sleep was associated with a very particular signature pattern of metabolism and particular phases of sleep are associated with sugar metabolism, or more with fat metabolism, or more with other aspects of metabolism. And the reason why I think this study is important to discuss in the context of today's discussion about sugar in the brain, is that many people have experienced the effects of disrupted sleep on their appetite. And in particular, it's been reported that when people are sleep deprived or the quality of their sleep is disrupted, that their appetite for sugary food increases. Now that was always assumed to be due to some metabolic need that was triggered by the sleep deprivation or by the poor sleep. But in reading over this study, some of the more important points made by the authors relate to the fact that well, sleep is known to have incredibly important effects on brain and body, for a variety of systems, immune system, neural functioning, et cetera. This very organized sequence of particular forms of metabolism being active during particular phases of sleep, which are very, very well orchestrated, as we know, slow wave sleep, and REM sleep being orchestrated in 90 minutes, so-called ultradian cycles and so on and so forth, is thought to of perhaps set up the brain and body to be able to regulate itself in the waking hours. And therefore, when people are sleep deprived or deprived of certain forms or states within sleep, such as rapid eye movement sleep, that it creates a disruption in a particular set of metabolic pathways. Now we don't a leap too far from this study to sugar metabolism and the neural circuits controlling sugar metabolism. But I will say this, if you look at the sum total of the data on obesity or on type two diabetes or on metabolic syndromes of any kind, you almost always see disruptions in sleep. Now, some of those could be you do to sleep apnea caused by even just the size of somebody's neck or the weight of their body. In other words, we don't know the direction of the effect, metabolic syndromes could disrupt sleep, which disrupt metabolic syndromes. And indeed the authors point out quite appropriately, that they don't understand the direction of the effects that they observe either. But there is now a plethora of data pointing to the fact that getting quality sleep each night helps regulate not only appetite, but also the specific forms of metabolism that drive specific appetites. So the takeaway is, while there are extravagant and potent and interesting ways to regulate blood glucose, everything from cinnamon to lemon juice, to Berberine, to sodium caprate, to behavioral tools, to the mere understanding of how the direct and indirect pathways go from the gut to dopamine, et cetera, if you're not establishing the firm foundation of proper metabolism, all of those things are going to be sort of rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic as it's sometimes described. So we can't overstate the importance of getting regular sufficient amount of high quality sleep, at least 80% of the time, not for sake of immune system function, for clear thinking, et cetera, but also for properly regulating our metabolism, including our sugar metabolism. Thank you for joining me for this discussion about sugar and the nervous system",
