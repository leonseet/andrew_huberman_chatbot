        "source_doc": "you there let's talk about treatments for ADHD and why stimulant treatments in particular can be so effective first of all it's long been known that there are specific brain networks involved in what we call attention now attention is not one thing actually it involves several different cognitive operations including the suppression of noise that is turning down the background chatter in our heads and turning down our attending to things outside us like noises or visual cues that are not relevant to what we want to do and it also involves ramping up or attending we're focusing on particular things that are happening either in our immediate environment or in our head or both so if that all sounds rather complex indeed it is it involves several different networks operating in parallel but what we know for sure based on a lot of clinical and scientific laboratory data is that the so-called prefrontal cortex the region of neural real estate in your brain just behind your forehead is critically important for orchestrating which neural circuits are going to be more or less active at a given moment in order to bring about what we call Focus or attention or task switching or our ability indeed to multitask because we can actually multitask to some extent in fact if you were to look at somebody and focus on perhaps the expression on their face you could do that while also attending to a conversation that's happening nearby it's energetically demanding it's hard to do but we can do that that's actually referred to as covert attention you're covertly paying attention to something else and then you can switch that attention back to just one thing or one small collection of things the point being that attention is a powerful resource it's what allows us to navigate through life with efficiency and to be adaptive in our behaviors it's what allows us to learn and to build relationships and have successful School careers and professional careers and so on but it is indeed expensive it takes metabolic resources you know just at rest if you were"

        "source_doc": "- Welcome to the Huberman lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [upbeat music] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford school of medicine. Today, we are going to talk all about attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. We are also going to talk about normal levels of focus. What are normal levels of focus and how all of us, whether or not we have ADHD or not can improve our ability to focus our ability to rule out distraction. It turns out those are two separate things, as well as remember information better. We are also going to talk about how we can learn to relax while focusing, which turns out to be a critical component of learning new information and for coming up with new creative ideas. So whether or not you have ADHD or know someone who does, or if you're somebody who feels that they do not have ADHD, but would simply like to improve their ability to focus or to be more creative. This episode is definitely for you as well. We are going to talk about drug based tools that are out there. We are going to talk about behavioral tools. We will talk about the role of diet and supplementation, and we will talk about new emerging brain machine interface devices, things like transcranial magnetic stimulation. If you don't know what that is, don't worry, I will explain it to you. These are non-invasive methods for rewiring your brain in order to make focusing more natural for you and to teach you how to increase your depth of focus. Now, just a quick reminder that any time we discuss a psychiatric disorder, it's important that we remember that all of us have the temptation to self-diagnose or to diagnose others. So, as I list off some of the symptomology of ADHD, some of that symptomology might resonate with you. You might think, oh, maybe I have ADHD or you might decide"

However, it is very important that you don't self-diagnose or diagnose somebody else the clear and real diagnosis of ADHD really should be carried out by a psychiatrist, a physician, or a very well-trained clinical psychologist. There are clear criteria for what constitutes full-blown ADHD. However, many of us have constellations of symptoms that make us somewhat like somebody with ADHD and if you're struggling with focus nowadays, as a lot of people are because of stress, because of smartphone use, which turns out can induce adult ADHD. We'll talk about that. We'll then pay attention to the symptomology. You may actually require professional treatment you might not, equally important is to remember that some of the terms that we cover, like impulse control and attention and concentration are somewhat subjective and they can change over time. Sometimes we have a better level of attention than others. Maybe it depends on how we slept or other events going on in our life where something that we're entirely unaware of. The important thing to remember is that we can all improve our attentional capacity. We can all rewire the circuits that make heightened levels of focus, more accessible to us. We can do that through multiple types of interventions, and we are going to cover all those interventions today. Before we march into the material,"

        "source_doc": "So let's talk about ADHD, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Let's also talk about focus and attention and everybody's ability to focus and attend not just people with ADHD. We are also going to talk about tools that would allow anyone, whether or not they have ADHD or not to enhance their level of concentration and focus. Now, ADHD used to be called ADD Attention Deficit Disorder. We have record of ADD in the medical literature dating back to as early as 1904. Now there's nothing special about 1904. That's just the first time that it showed up in the standard medical literature. We have to believe that ADD, which we now call ADHD existed before 1904 and probably long before 1904, why? Well, because it has a strong genetic component. If you have a close relative that has ADHD, there's a much higher probability that you will have ADHD and that probability goes up depending on how closely related to that person you happen to be. So for instance, if you're an identical twin and your twin has ADHD, there's a very high concordance as we say, a very high probability that you will have ADHD up to 75% chance. If you have a fraternal twin with ADHD, that number goes down a bit in the 50 to 60% range and so on. If you have a parent with ADHD, that number ranges anywhere from 10 to 25% likelihood, that you will have ADHD if you have two parents and so on and so on, okay? So there's a genetic component that genetic component it turns out, relates directly to how specific neural circuits in the brain wire up, the chemicals they use and the way they use those chemicals, a topic that we are going to discuss in depth today. Now, if you have a close relative with ADHD, that does not mean that you are faded to have ADHD and if you happen to have"

        "source_doc": "with ADHD, that does not mean that you are faded to have ADHD and if you happen to have ADHD, there are ways to overcome those symptoms of lack of attention, impulsivity and so on. Another important point about ADHD is that it has nothing to do with intelligence, whether or not we're talking about intelligence measured by a standard IQ test a rather controversial issue as many of you probably know, there are lots of forms of intelligence that a standard IQ test just wouldn't pick up emotional intelligence, musical intelligence, spatial intelligence, all sorts of intelligences. None of them are related to ADHD. Being very high functioning doesn't make you more likely to have ADHD and being ADHD doesn't necessarily mean that you have a low IQ. So there are people with ADHD who have low IQs people with ADHD with high IQ, people with ADHD with high emotional IQ or with low IQ in the emotional scale, it's all over the place. The important point is that your ability to attend and focus does not relate to how smart you are or your IQ of any type, not just a standard IQ. The renaming of the ADD to ADHD took place in the mid to late 1980s when the psychiatric community and the psychological community started taking better notice of the fact that so-called hyperactive kids also had attentional issues. This might seem obvious, but there's been extensive and ongoing revision of the criteria for designating a psychiatric disorder and this is still an ongoing process even today. So in the mid eighties, we started hearing about ADHD and then gradually that term ADD has been dropped away. However, just the renaming of ADD to ADHD has led to much better diagnosis and detection of ADHD. So right now the current estimates are that about one in 10 children and probably more have ADHD. The current estimates are anywhere from 10%, one in 10 to as high as 12%. Now, fortunately about half of those will resolve with proper"

The other thing that we are seeing a lot nowadays is increased levels of ADHD in adults and there's some question as to whether or not those adults had ADHD that went undetected during their childhood or whether or not ADHD is now cropping up in adulthood due to the way that we are interacting with the world in particular smart phone use, the combination of email, text, real-world interactions, multiple apps and streams of media and social media all coming in at once trying to manage life. All of the things that are going on are creating a kind of cloud of poles on our attention and so there is this question to whether or not we are creating ADHD in adults that never had ADHD prior to being an adult. So let's talk about attention and first let's just define what we mean by attention"

        "source_doc": "and first let's just define what we mean by attention out there in the scientific literature and in discussions about ADHD, we will hear things like attention and focus and concentration and impulse control for sake of today's discussion, attention, focus, and concentration are essentially the same thing, okay? We could split hairs and the scientific literature does split hairs about these. But if we want to understand the biology and we want to have a straightforward conversation about ADHD, if I say attention or focus, I'm basically referring to the same thing, unless I specify otherwise, okay? So people with ADHD have trouble holding their attention. What is attention? Well, attention is perception. It's how we are perceiving the sensory world. So just a little bit of neurobiology 101, we are sensing things all the time. There's information coming into our nervous system all the time. For instance, right now you're hearing sound waves. You are seeing things, you are sensing things against your skin, but you're only paying attention to some of those and the ones that you're paying attention to are your perceptions. So if you hear my voice, you are perceiving my voice. You are not paying attention to your other senses at the moment, okay? You might even be outside in a breeze and until I said that, you might not be perceiving that breeze, but your body was sensing it all along. So attention and focus are more or less the same thing, but impulse control is something separate because impulse control requires pushing out or putting the blinders on to sensory events in our environment. It means lack of perception, impulse control is about limiting our perception. People with ADHD have poor attention and they have high levels of impulsivity they're easily distractable. But the way that shows up is very surprising. You might think that people with ADHD"

        "source_doc": "You might think that people with ADHD just simply can't attend anything. They really can't focus, even if they really want to, but that's simply not the case. People with ADHD yes, they are distractable. Yes, they are impulsive. Yes, they are easily annoyed by things happening in the room. They sometimes have a high level of emotionality as well. Not always, but often however people with ADHD can have a hyper focus and incredible ability to focus on things that they really enjoy or and are intrigued by. Now, this is a very important point because typically we think of somebody with ADHD as being really wild and hyperactive, or having no ability whatsoever to sit still and attend and while that phenotype as we call it that contour of behavior and cognition can exist, many people, if not all people with ADHD, if you give them something they really love, like if the child loves video games or if a child loves to draw, or if an adult loves a particular type of movie or a person very much, they will obtain laser-focus without any effort. So that tells us that people with ADHD have the capacity to attend, but they can't engage that attention for things that they don't really, really want to do and as we all know much of life, whether or not you're a child or an adult involves doing a lot of things that we don't want to do, much of our schooling involves doing things that we would prefer not to do and sort of forcing ourselves to do it, to attend, even though we are not super interested in what we are attending to. There are a couple other things that people with ADHD display quite often. One is challenges with time perception."

        "source_doc": "One is challenges with time perception. Now time perception is a fascinating aspect of how our brain works and later we're going to talk about time perception and how you can actually get better at time perception. It's very likely that right now you are doing things that get in the way of optimal time perception and I will tell you how to adjust your ability to measure time with your brain. People with ADHD often run late. They often procrastinate, but what's interesting and surprising is that if they are given a deadline, they actually can perceive time very well and they often can focus very well if the consequences of not completing a task or not attending are severe enough. It's a little bit like the way that people with ADHD can really focus if they like something. Well, if they're scared enough about the consequences of not attending, oftentimes not always, but oftentimes they can attend. If they're not really concerned about a deadline or a consequence, well, then they tend to lose track of time and they tend to underestimate how long things will take. Now many people do that, not just people with ADHD, but people with ADHD have challenges, understanding how to line up the activities of their day in order to meet particular deadlines even if it's just a simple thing, like finishing one set of tasks before lunch, oftentimes they will remember that lunch starts at noon, but somehow they aren't able to fill the intervening time in a way that's productive and they can obsess about the upcoming deadline for instance, we will talk about how to remedy this.

        "source_doc": "In addition, their spatial organization skills are often subpar, not always, but often you will find that somebody with ADHD uses what's called the pile system in order to organize things, they will take many belongings and this could be in the kitchen or in their bedroom or in their office or in any space and they will start piling things up according to a categorization system that makes sense to them and only them. It doesn't really have any logical framework. Now, many people use the pile system and if you use the pile system, that doesn't mean that you have ADHD in fact, if you're unpacking a house or you've moved recently, or you've received a lot of presence recently, the pile system makes perfect sense to organize your space. But people with ADHD tend to organize things according to the pile system all the time and that pile system doesn't work for them. Okay, so that's the key distinction that they use a filing system, and it's not really files, they're piling things up in a way that makes sense to them, but then it doesn't work for them in terms of what tasks they actually need to perform. They can't find things or if anyone moves one thing then it's very disruptive to their overall plan because their overall plan doesn't really work in the first place. So that's a common phenotype as we call it. A phenotype by the way, is just an expression of a particular set of underlying genetic or psychological components, okay? So we say the phenotype. So a phenotype can brown hair and green eyes, like for me, a phenotype could also be that somebody uses the piling system, okay? The other thing that people with ADHD have real trouble with"

        "source_doc": "The other thing that people with ADHD have real trouble with is so-called working memory. Now you might think that people with ADHD would have really poor memories, but in fact, that's not the case. People with ADHD often can have a terrific memory for past events, they can remember upcoming events quite well. Their memory is clearly working. However, one aspect of memory in particular that we call working memory is often disrupted. Working memory is the ability to keep specific information online, to recycle it in your brain over and over again, so that you can use it in the immediate or short term. A good example of this would be you meet somebody, they tell you their name, they give you their phone number verbally, and you have to walk back to your phone and enter it into your phone. People without ADHD might have to put some effort into it, it might feel like a bit of a struggle, but typically they will be able to recite that phone number in their mind over and over, and then put into their phone. People with ADHD, tend to lose the ability or lack the ability to remember things that they just need to keep online for anywhere from 10 seconds to a minute or two, okay? So a string of numbers like 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1 for most people would be pretty easy. 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, you could probably remember that a minute from now without writing it down. But if you add one more number to that 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, 3, it gets tougher, okay? So there's a reason why phone numbers typically have seven digits in them, of course, there's an area code, but remembering information that strings out longer than seven numbers or a sentence or two that's"

        "source_doc": "area code, but remembering information that strings out longer than seven numbers or a sentence or two that's challenging for most people, people with ADHD have severe challenges, even with much smaller batches of information over even much smaller batches of time. Deficits in working memory are also something that we see in people who have frontotemporal dementia, so damage to the frontal lobes or age-related cognitive decline and so it will come as no surprise that later when we discuss treatments, supplements, and other tools for ADHD, that many of those treatments, supplements and tools for ADHD are similar to the ones that work for age-related cognitive decline. Okay, so we've more or less established the kind of menu of items that people with ADHD tend to have some have all of them. Some have just a subset of them. Their severity can range from very intense to mild, but in general, it's challenges with attention and focus, challenges with impulse control, they get annoyed easily. They have kind of an impulsivity, they can't stay on task. Time perception can be off, they use the piling system or a system that doesn't work well for them in order to organize their things in physical space and they have a hard time with anything that's mundane that they're not really interested in. But again, I just want to highlight that people with ADHD are able to obtain heightened levels of focus, even hyper-focus for things that are exciting to them and that they really want to engage in. So now you have the contour of what ADHD is, and if you're somebody who doesn't have ADHD, you should also be asking yourself which aspects of ADHD are similar to things I've experienced before. Because what we know about the healthy brain is that there's also a range of abilities to focus. Some people focus very well on any task. You give them a task, they can just laser in on that task. Other people that have to kind of fight an internal battle, they have to convince themselves that"

        "source_doc": "actually can focus very intensely on things that they enjoy and are curious about. Now, enjoyment and curiosity are psychological terms, they're not even really psychological terms. They're just the way that we describe our human experience of liking things, wanting to know more about them. But from a neuro-biological perspective, they have a very clear identity and signature and that's dopamine. Dopamine is released from neurons, it's what we call a neuromodulator and as a neuromodulator it changes the activity of the circuits in the brain, such that certain circuits are more active than others and in particular, dopamine creates a heightened state of focus. It tends to contract our visual world and it tends to make us pay attention to things that are outside and beyond the confines of our skin. That's what we call exteroception. Dopamine also tends to put us in a state of motivation and wanting things outside the confines of our skin. So whether or not we're pursuing something physical in our world, or whether or not we're pursuing information in our outside world, dopamine is largely responsible for our ability and our drive to do that. But dopamine as a neuromodulator is also involved in changing the way that we perceive the world. So, as I mentioned earlier you have all these senses coming in and you can only perceive some of them because you're only paying attention to some of them. Dopamine when it's released in our brain tends to turn on areas of our brain that narrow our visual focus and our auditory focus, so it creates a cone of auditory attention, that's very narrow, creates a tunnel of visual attention that's very narrow. Whereas when we have less dopamine, we tend to view the entire world, we tend to see the whole scene that we are in, we tend to hear everything all at once. So as I describe this, hopefully you're already starting to see and understand how having dopamine release can allow a person, whether or not they have"

So let's talk neurocircuits and for those of you that love hearing neuroscience, nomenclature, you're going to eat this part up and for those of you that don't like a lot of names of brain areas I invite you to tune out or just try and grab the top contour of this. I will describe it in pretty general terms, but I will give some detail because I know there are some of you out there who really want to dig deeper into what the exact structures and connectivities are, okay? So there are two main types of circuits that we need to think about with respect to ADHD, attention and dopamine. The first one is called the default mode network. The default mode network is the network of brain areas in your brain and my brain and in everybody's brain that is active when we're not doing anything when we're just sitting there idle at rest. Now it's very hard to not think about anything, but when you're not engaged in any type of specific task, so you're not driving, you're not playing a video game, you're not trying to study, you're not trying to listen, you're just sitting there letting your brain kind of go wherever it wants to go. Your default mode network underlies that state of mind. The other set of circuits that we're going to think about and talk about with respect to ADHD are the task networks, the networks of the brain that make you goal oriented, or that are at least trying to make you goal oriented and those are a completely different set of brain areas. However, the default mode network and these tasks networks are communicating with one another and they're doing that in very interesting ways. So first I want to describe how these two sets of brain areas, the default mode network and the task networks normally interact, okay?"

        "source_doc": "these two sets of brain areas, the default mode network and the task networks normally interact, okay? So little bit of naming here again feel free to ignore it if you don't want this level of detail, but the default mode network includes an area called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, frontal cortex, no surprises in the front and you have a dorsal, the top and side lateral part dorsolateral, prefrontal cortex. You got one on each side of your brain, right? And then you have a brain area called the posterior cingulate cortex and then you have an area called the lateral parietal lobe. Again, you don't need to remember these names for, these are three brain areas that normally are synchronized in their activity. So when one of these areas is active in a typical person, the other areas would be active as well. So it's a little bit like a symphony or a band like a three-piece band is like drums, guitar, and bass they're playing together, okay? That's how it is in a typical person and in a person with ADHD, or even a person who has subclinical ADHD or in any human being who hasn't slept well, what you find is the default mode network is not synchronized. These brain areas are just not playing well together. Now the task networks include a different set of structures. It still involves the prefrontal cortex, but it's a different part of the prefrontal cortex, okay? Tends to be the medial prefrontal cortex and there are some other brain areas that the medial prefrontal cortex is communicating to all the time, mainly to suppress impulses. It's shutting down the desire to stand up or to scratch the side of your cheek or your nose, if you're trying not to do that, anytime you're restricting your behavior, These task directed networks are very active, okay?

Now normally in a person without ADHD, the task networks and the default mode networks are going in kind of Seesaw fashion, they are actually what we call anti-correlated. So it's not just that they are not correlated, they're actually opposing one another they are anti-correlated. In a person with ADHD, the default mode networks and the tasks networks are actually more coordinated. That might come a surprising, I think that we all have this tendency to kind of jump to conclusion and assume that somebody who doesn't have an easy time paying attention or has ADHD, that their brain must be completely incoherent that it's not working well and because everything's out of whack, but there's something interesting about people with ADHD whereby the task networks and the default mode networks are actually working together in a way that's correlated and that is what's abnormal. So this would be like the guitar bass and the drums playing together in a way where the bass isn't keeping the backbeat and the drums, aren't keeping the backbeat that they're playing together, they're all playing the melodies and harmonies in a way that just doesn't sound right. That's what's going on in the brain of somebody with ADHD and we can now confidently say based on brain imaging studies, that when somebody gets better, when they're treated for ADHD or when they age out of ADHD, as sometimes it's the case that the default mode networks and the task networks tend to become anti-correlated again, okay? So that's the underlying neurobiology, but you'll notice that I didn't mention dopamine at all. What dopamine is doing in this context is dopamine is acting like a conductor. Dopamine is saying this circuit should be active then that circuit should be active. It should be default mode network and then when the default mode network is not active, then it should be the"

Out of phase and anti correlate, essentially the same thing, at least for purposes of this discussion. So that raises two questions, could it be that dopamine is not at sufficiently high levels or could it be that dopamine is just doing it all wrong? In other words, is there no conductor or is the conductor playing with like little tiny toothpicks and so the instruments can't see what they're supposed to do. They can't get the instruction 'cause it's just not loud enough, so to speak, or could it be that the information is getting out, but the information that's getting out is wrong, the conductor's there, but the conductor is in very good at conducting.

So what exactly is going on with the dopamine system, in people with ADHD and what's going on with the dopamine system in people that have terrific levels of attention for any task? Well, in the year 2015, an important paper came out. The first author is Spencer, and it came out in a journal called Biological Psychiatry, and it formalized the so-called low dopamine hypothesis of ADHD. The idea that dopamine was somehow involved or not at the appropriate levels in people with ADHD had been around for a pretty long time, but a formal proposition of the low dopamine hypothesis led to some really important experiments and understanding of what goes wrong in ADHD. It turns out that if dopamine levels are too low in particular circuits in the brain, that it leads to unnecessary firing of neurons in the brain that are unrelated to the task that one is trying to do and that is unrelated to the information that one is trying to focus on. So if you think back before you've got this default mode network and a task-related network, and they need to be in this kind of concert of anti-correlation and an ADHD they're firing together. Well, the problem seems to be that when dopamine is low, certain neurons are firing when they shouldn't be, this is like a band, right? We'll go back to our band, that's a guitar bass in it, and the person playing the drums and it's as if"

The pauses and music are just as important as the actual playing of notes. When dopamine is too low neurons fire, more than they should in these networks that govern attention. This is the so-called low dopamine hypothesis and if you start looking anecdotally at what people with ADHD have done for decades, not just recently since the low dopamine hypothesis has been proposed, but what they were doing in the 1950s and then the 1940s and the 1960s. What you find is that they tend to use recreational drugs, or they tend to indulge in non drug stimulants. So things like drinking, six cups of coffee or quadruple espressos, or when it was more prominent smoking a half a pack of cigarettes and drinking four cups of coffee a day or if the person had access to it using cocaine as a recreational drug or amphetamine as a recreational drug. All of those substances that I just described in particular cocaine and amphetamine, but also coffee and cigarettes increase levels of multiple neurotransmitters, but all have the quality of increasing levels of dopamine in the brain and in particular, in the regions of the brain that regulate attention and these task related and default mode networks okay? Now young children, fortunately don't have access to those kinds of stimulants most of the time and those stimulants all have high potential for abuse in adults. So we will talk about the potential for abuse in a few minutes. But if you look at children, even very young children with ADHD, they show things like preference for sugary foods, which also act as dopamine inducing stimulants. Now, of course, once they get access to soda pop and coffee and tea, they start to indulge in those more than other people. For a"

Things like cocaine lead to huge increases in dopamine. Well, what happens was when somebody with ADHD takes that drug, it turns out they actually obtain heightened levels of focus, their ability to focus on things other than things they absolutely care intensely about goes up, likewise, children who consume anything that increases their levels of dopamine, if those children have ADHD, they tend to be calmer, they tend to be able to focus more. Now, this is very different than children who do not have ADHD. When they consume too much sugar, they tend to become super hyperactive. When they consume any kind of stimulant, they tend to go wild and run around like crazy. Actually, I have an anecdote about this just to illustrate it. I have a friend, he has two children that are now in their teens and twenties, but when they were little, one time, I brought them some chocolate just as a gift, when I showed up at their house and within 30 minutes, the kids were running around like crazy I mean they were pretty high energy kids, but they were going bonkers and that's actually when the mother, my friend at the time, unfortunately, still now looked at the chocolate, realized that it was chocolate"

It's the sugar combined with the caffeine in this case, combined with a few other compounds that exist in chocolate, that really increase our levels of alertness and our tendency to want to move around a lot, okay? So dopamine and low levels of dopamine apparently are what's wrong in people with ADHD, that dopamine hypothesis is what led to the idea that treating people, children and adults included with dopaminergic compounds would somehow increase their ability to focus and if you look at the major drugs that were developed and now marketed by pharmaceutical companies for the treatment of ADHD, those drugs have names like Ritalin. Nowadays, it's typically things like Adderall, Modafinil and some of the other derivatives, they all serve to increase levels of dopamine in particular dopamine in the networks that control task directed behavior, and that coordinate the default mode network and these task-related networks. So many of you have probably heard of Ritalin. Ritalin is a prescription stimulant that is prescribed for ADHD as well as for narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a condition in which people tend to fall asleep during the day time, quite a lot, excessive daytime sleepiness, not due to lack of sleep at night, but also tend to fall asleep when they get excited, if they're really emotionally excited or about to eat or any other kind of activity that would normally get somebody really aroused and alert people with narcolepsy tend to fall asleep, or they tend to become what's called cataplectic. They tend to just sort of go limp in the muscles."

Adderall also is used to treat ADHD and to treat narcolepsy things like Modafinil also used to treat ADHD and narcolepsy. So you're sensing a theme here. So what are the differences and similarities between these drugs and what can that tell us about ADHD? Well, Ritalin was one of the first-generation drugs that was prescribed for ADHD in order to deal head on with this dopamine hypothesis. This idea that in ADHD, dopamine levels are too low. Nowadays, Adderall is the more typically prescribed drug for ADHD that has to do with some of the so-called pharmacokinetics, the rate at which those drugs enter the system and how long they last in the system. So for instance, Ritalin was a drug that was packaged into various time-release formulas. Whereas initially Adderall was only released in a form that had a very short life, So meaning that it wasn't in the bloodstream very long and didn't affect the brain for very long and so the dosages could be controlled in a more typical way without going into a lot of tangential detail. As you all know, at different times of day, you tend to be more or less alert. So a long sustained release drug while that might sound like a really terrific thing. If that drug is having an effect of making you more alert and it's released across very many hours of your day, there might be periods of your day when you feel too alert, periods of your day, when you feel just right and periods of your day, when you wished"

Let's take a step back for a second and just ask, what are these drugs? We know they increase dopamine, but what are they really? Well, Ritalin also called methylphenidate is very similar to amphetamine speed, or what's typically call speed in the street drug nomenclature. Adderall, which goes by various other names, okay? So Adderall, Adderall XR, my dialysis, things like that. Adderall is basically a combination of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Now some of you probably realize this, that Adderall is amphetamine, but I'm guessing that there a good number of you out there, perhaps even parents and kids that don't realize that these drugs like cocaine and amphetamine methamphetamine, which are incredibly dangerous and incredibly habit forming and have high potential for abuse. Well, the pharmaceutical versions of those are exactly what are used to treat ADHD and they're not exactly like cocaine or methamphetamine, but they are structurally and chemically very similar and their net effect in the brain and body is essentially the same, which is to increase dopamine primarily, but also to increase levels of a neuromodulator called epinephrin or norepinephrine also called noradrenaline and adrenaline those names are the same and to some extent to increase levels of serotonin in the brain and blood, but not so much serotonin, that's just kind of a small"

So that's motivation drive, focus and energy and to some extent, a little bit of serotonin, which is really more about feeling calm and relaxed and you can imagine why that would be a good balancing effect for dopamine and norepinephrine. So what I'm essentially saying is that the drugs that are used to treat ADHD are stimulants, and they look very much alike. In fact, nearly identical to some of the so-called street drugs, stimulants that we all here are so terrible. However, I do want to emphasize that at the appropriate dosages and working with a quality psychiatrist or neurologist or family physician does have to be a board certified MD that prescribes these things, many people with ADHD achieve excellent relief with these drugs, not all of them, but many of them do, especially if these treatments are started early in life. So now knowing what these drugs are, I want to raise the question of why prescribe these drugs? I mean, everyone has to make a decision for themselves or for their child as to whether or not they're going to take these things or not. I also want to acknowledge that many people out there, many, many people out there are taking these drugs, even though they have not been clinically diagnosed with ADHD when I say these drugs, I'm specifically referring to Ritalin and Adderall and Modafinil, but more typically it's Adderall, okay? People using cocaine and amphetamine for recreational purposes, that's a completely different beast and it is indeed a beast and it's something that I strongly discourage.

        "source_doc": "are taking things like Adderall, despite not having a clinical diagnosis of ADHD. Well, that's a ridiculously high number. A few years ago, it was estimated that Adderall use and Ritalin use without diagnosis of ADHD was second in incident only to cannabis, but actually now the consumption of Adderall without prescription is higher than the consumption of cannabis in that age group. So what that means is that there's a lot of stimulant use in that age group and there are a lot of adults also using and abusing stimulants in order to gain focus. Then we can have a whole discussion about whether or not life is becoming more demanding, whether or not the need for focus is excessive and that's why people are doing that. But frankly, it's an interesting discussion, but it's not one that would deliver us to any answers. Rather, I'd like to focus on the ways that people now and people have always been self-medicating to increase, focus, right? Caffeine, which I can indulge some, I don't think to access has long been used as a stimulant to increase dopamine, increase norepinephrine, increased focus and energy and in addition to that, it works through the so-called cyclic amp, phosphodiesterase pathway, remember anytime you see, you hear an ASE, that's an enzyme. Phosphodiesterase is involved in the conversion of things like cyclic amp into energy for cells and so forth. Basically coffee gives you energy it makes you feel good and it increases focus because of the circuits that it engages in the brain. People have been taking caffeine and continue to take it caffeine for ages. People also used to smoke cigarettes, nicotine in order to gain focus. Nowadays, that's less common because of the concerns, quite valid concerns about lung cancer from smoking, but there's a lot of vaping out there. There are a lot of people now consuming"

        "source_doc": "It's just that in ADHD, it's surprising that these things would work, right? I mean, if the problem is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, what we're really talking about here, or children that are prescribed a drug that ought to be a stimulant, it ought to make them hyper hyperactive and rather than doing that, it actually somehow serves to calm them a bit, or at least allow them to focus. Here's the reason, children have a brain that's a very plastic meaning it can remodel itself and change in response to experience very, very quickly compared to adults. Taking stimulants as a child, if you are a child diagnosed with ADHD allows that forebrain task related network to come online, to be active at the appropriate times and because those children are young, it allows those children to learn what focus is and to sort of follow or enter that tunnel of focus. Now, by taking a drug, it's creating focus artificially, it's not creating focus because they're super interested in something it's chemically inducing, a state of focus, and let's face it a lot of childhood and school and becoming a functional adult is about learning how to focus even though you don't want to do something. In fact, when I was in college, I had this little trick that may or may not work for some of you, which is if I couldn't focus on the material I was trying to learn, I would delude myself into thinking that it was the most interesting thing in the world. I would just kind of lie to myself and tell myself, okay, this, I won't mention the subjects, I absolutely love this.

They are told that they can't speak out in class or that they have to remain in their seats for 10 minutes and they just, despite their best effort, they simply cannot do it, they're highly distractable.

So we had a discussion about this and prior to learning that their child may have ADHD. I asked the following questions. First of all, I asked, what do you think about giving young kids amphetamine? And their answer was, on the face of it, it seems crazy, but provided that the lowest possible dose is used and that that dosage is modulating as they grow older and develop those powers of attention, their observation was that they've seen more kids benefit than not benefit from that. Now I'm certainly not saying what people should do. You obviously have to go to a doctor because as I always say, I'm not a doctor, I don't prescribe anything, I'm a professor so I profess things and here I'm professing that you talk to your doctor, if you're considering giving Ritalin or Adderall or any type of stimulant to your child, of course, what could be more important than the health of your child.

Now the fact that this person, this now friend of mine and colleague of mine has so much expertise in the way that the brain works and is considering putting their child on such medication. I said, why wouldn't you wait until your kid reaches puberty? I mean, we know that in boys and in girls, there are increases in testosterone and estrogen during puberty, that dramatically change the way that the body appears. But also that dramatically change the way that the brain functions in particular we know this, that puberty triggers the activation of so-called frontotemporal task related executive functioning. That's just fancy science speak for being able to focus, being able to direct your attention, being able to control your impulses, look at a small child, or look at a puppy and then look at an older child, or look at a dog, very different levels, patterns of spontaneous behavior. Young children move around a lot they're, I don't want to say shifty, cause that makes it sound like they're up to something bad, which they might be, but they don't have to be up to something bad, they fidget a lot. So to puppies, everything's a stimulus as animals and humans get older, they learn how to control their behavior and sit, still, listen and focus even if they don't want to. So giving a drug that allows a child to access that stillness early on it's thought will allow them to maintain that ability as time goes on. But I decided to push a little bit further, I said, well, why would you do it now as opposed to during puberty or after puberty?

So this lines up really well with the clinical literature. Not surprisingly, there are clinician that early treatment is key. If you have the opportunity to work with a quality physician and treat these things early, these drugs can allow these frontal circuits, these task-related circuits to achieve their appropriate levels of functioning and for kids to learn how to focus in a variety of different contexts.

        "source_doc": "So the next question I asked was what should we make of all this diet related stuff, right? I've heard before that the so-called elimination diet or ingesting no sugars or no dairy or no gluten, that all of these things have been purported to improve symptoms of ADHD and people and parents with ADHD go to fanatic lanes to try and find the exact foods that are causing problems and the exact foods that the kids can eat in order to try and get their brain wired up right, and correctly, and to avoid lifelong ADHD and their answer was really interesting. But before I tell you their answer, I want to tell you the studies and the data related to this question of whether or not food and the constellation of foods that one avoids and will eat has anything to do with our levels of attention and in particular, whether or not that can be used as a leverage point to treat ADHD. So you can imagine the challenges of exploring the role of diet and nutrition in any study, but especially in a study on ADHD, why? Well, because as I mentioned before, children with ADHD, and it turns out adults with ADHD tend to pursue sugary foods or any types of food that increase their levels of dopamine. They are naturally drawn to those foods, whether or not they realize it or not, presumably as a way to try and treat their lack of focus and impulsivity. So in this study that I'm about to share with you, there was no drug treatment, it was just a study, manipulating diet and involved 100 children, 50 in the so-called elimination diet group, the special diet where certain foods were eliminated and 50 in the so-called control group. However, being a well-designed randomized controlled trial, this study also included a crossover, meaning where the kids would serve as their own control or control group at a certain portion of the study. So there'll be in one group where they eliminated certain foods and then after a period of time in the"

This is a powerful way to design a study for reasons that you can imagine, because you start to eliminate changes and effects due to individual differences. In any case, 100 children total 50 in each group at any one period in time and the effects that they observed were extremely dramatic. In the world of statistics and analysis of scientific data, we talk about P-values, probability values. What's the likelihood that something could happen according to chance and typically the cutoff would be something like P less than 0.05, that's less than 0.05 chance essentially, of the effect being due to chance. However, in this study, every single one of the effects is P less than 0.0001, very, very infant decimally small probability that the effect observed could be due to chance. So what were these effects? These effects were enhanced ability to focus, less impulsivity, even less tendency to move when trying to sit still. So everything from mental focus to the ability to control their bodies improved when they were in the elimination diet group, what was eliminated? Well, the elimination diet in this particular study was a so-called oligoantigenic diet. It was a diet in which each kid took a test to determine which foods they had antibodies for, meaning that they were mildly allergic to. Now in this study, it was very important that the kids not be extremely allergic to any food because as I mentioned before, they actually served as a control at one point in the study where they were eating all sorts of foods, including foods that had mild allergies to. So basically what the study said was that eliminating foods to which children have allergies can dramatically improve their symptoms of ADHD.

People were extremely excited about these results because here in the absence of any drug treatment, there was a significant improvement in ADHD symptoms observed and then came the criticisms. So many papers were published after this specifically dealing with re-analysis of these data and I want to be fair in saying that the data in the paper look good, but there are criticisms of the overall structural design of the study. I don't want to go into all the details exactly 'cause it gets really nuanced about some of the statistics and the way that one examines these types of data, but there was skepticism and in science, skepticism is healthy, especially when making decisions about whether or not to treat or feed children one food or another, or give them one drug or another. Now I want to return to the story of my friend, who is a pediatric neurologist and treats ADHD and has a child who is on the precipice of perhaps starting to take drugs for the treatment of ADHD. I asked the simple question, do you see an effect of diet? Meaning when parents control the diet of their children, does it make a positive or negative or no difference in terms of the way that the kids respond to ADHD, drugs like Ritalin and Adderall or whether or not it can help them avoid treating with those drugs entirely? And her response was very straightforward, she said, elimination of simple sugars has a dramatic and positive effect. She's observed that over and over and over again in many dozens, if not hundreds of patients, okay? Now that's not a peer reviewed study, that's a statement that I'm conveying to you anecdotally, but it's a highly, highly informed one. I said, what about these elimination diets?

There are many people who really believe in identifying all the things that you're allergic to and making sure that you and especially your kids avoid those foods. However, there's another camp that's starting to emerge in the peer reviewed scientific literature, showing that when kids are not exposed to certain foods in particular nuts and things of that sort, they develop allergies to those foods and then when exposed to them later, they cause real problems. So there's a whole galaxy of discussion and controversy and outright fighting about allergies and kids and whether or not the oligoantigenic diet is the appropriate one. However, out of the four neurologists and psychiatrists that I spoke to about ADHD in preparation for this, every single one said children with ADHD, as much as possible, should be encouraged to avoid high sugar and simple sugar foods of most kinds and if they can find particular foods that exacerbate their symptoms, obviously eliminating those foods is beneficial and the foods that exacerbate their symptoms change over time. So I don't like giving a complicated answer, but I also don't like giving an incomplete answer. What this tells me is that children, especially young children who have ADHD should probably not eat much sugar in particular simple sugars. In addition to that, exploring whether or not they have existing allergies to foods, they already consume might be a good idea. At least that's what this paper, the Pelsser et. al Lancet paper seems to speak to and I should mention that that paper was published in 2011. Since then there have been many dozens of studies exploring the same thing, as well as meta analysis of all those data and it does appear that diet can have a highly significant role in eliminating or at least reducing the symptoms of ADHD so much so that some of the children are able to not take medication at"

I've talked many times on this podcast about the known benefits of omega-3 fatty acids in particular, getting a one gram 1000 milligrams or more even as much as 2000 milligrams each day of the so-called EPA component of omega-3 fatty acids known to have antidepressant effects, mood elevating effects, known to have important effects protecting the cardiovascular system. I think it's now clear that the immune system also benefits that omega-3 fatty acids that include a gram or more of EPA that are very beneficial typically that's done through fish oil, liquid fish oil is going to be the most cost efficient, but they're capsule forms for those of you that don't like fish oil, you can ingest this through other means you can get it from certain algaes or krill, et cetera. You have to make it compatible with your particular diet, whether or not you're vegan or vegetarian or omnivore, et cetera. Omega-3s have shown, been shown to have all these positive health benefits. Do they have positive effects on focus and attention? And the answer is you can find studies that support that statement and the effects are significant, but the effects are modest. You can also find studies that show no effect, however much like with omega-3s and antidepressants, whereby ingestion of omega-3 fatty acids of a gram or more of EPA per day allows people with major depression to get away with taking lower doses of antidepressant medication. It does seem that ingestion of omega-3 fatty acids in adults that include EPA is of 1000 milligrams or more can allow adults with ADHD or mild attention deficit issues to function well on lower doses of medication and in rare cases to eliminate medication entirely.

This component of modulation is extremely important to highlight and I think I want to spend a moment on it because this is especially important in the context of ADHD and all the information that's out there. There are biological processes that are mediated by particular compounds like dopamine. So for instance, the ability to feel motivated, to attend to focus is mediated by the circuits in the brain that release dopamine. However, attention is also modulating by how rested you are. If you want to eliminate your ability to think well at all, just stay up for two nights and don't sleep at all right? If you do that, you will have modulating the circuits in your brain that respond to various things and you will be highly distractible. You'll be highly emotional. You will feel like garbage, but that doesn't mean that sleep mediates, focus and attention. It modulates it indirectly. Likewise, I think these omega-3 fatty acids in particular the EPA is which are so beneficial for mood and apparently also for attention, they directly mediate attention and mood, what they do is they modulate those circuits, they make dopamine more available. They make whatever dopamine is available, more likely to bind to the various receptors that are present on neurons and so forth and I think this is very important because likewise diet in any discussion about nutrition has to include this framework of is the diet, the elimination diet, or whether or not it's some other diet or esoteric diet, ketogenic diet, is it modulating or mediating a process? And most likely in the context of ADHD, it's modulating that process.

So I hope that conceptual framework helps because if you go online, if you're somebody with ADHD or not your going to be bombarded with the ADHD diet, the oligoantigenic diet, the elimination this, this supplement that EPA and I think it's very important to understand whether or not you're talking about something mediating a process or modulating a process. Now drugs like Ritalin, drugs like Adderall, they are tapping into the circuitries and the neurochemistries that mediate attention and focus. They are not the only alternatives or the only choices rather for treatment of these circuits and enhancement of the circuits for focus. I'm going to talk about other alternatives and some behavioral alternatives that are not very well known, but are very, very effective in a few minutes. But I really want to make this clear distinction between modulation and mediation, because it's vital for anyone that's trying to modulate or mediate anything within their own brain. If any of you are interested in this oligoantigenic diet, as it relates to ADHD, and you want to explore a more recent study besides that classic 2011 Lancet study, that's rather controversial. There's a paper that was published in frontiers in psychiatry just last year, 2020. The title of the paper is, \"Oligoantigenic diet improves children's ADHD rating scale scores reliably in added video rating.\" The added video rating is just that they're using an additional measure of focus and attention.

I'd rather paraphrase from them than try and just make up a new way to say it that is less interesting or less good, but I"

Attentional blinks are really easy to understand, if you think about a where's Waldo task, you know this task where's Waldo where, there are a bunch of people and objects and things in a picture and somewhere in there is Waldo with the striped hat and the glasses and go skinny dude, and you have to find Waldo and so it's a visual search and it's visual search for an object that has distinct features, but is embedded in this ocean of other things that could easily be confused as Waldo. So you tend to look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, and then you find Waldo. Kids can do this they enjoy doing this. Adults may or may not enjoy it, but they can do it too. They find Waldo, when you find Waldo or when you search for a target in some other visual search task at that moment, your nervous system celebrates a little bit and it celebrates through the release of neurochemicals that make you feel good, you found it and you pause. Now, the pause is interesting because when you pause, what we know from many experiments is that in that moment of pause and mild celebration, however, mild you are not able to see another Waldo sitting right next to it. So what this means is in attending to something in searching and in identifying a visual target your attention blinked it shut off for a second and there's a more formal and more laboratory type way that we look at this. The more typical way to do this is to give someone a string of letters or a string of numbers and beforehand you tell them be on the lookout for the letters R and Z, okay? You're just going to watch this string of numbers go by and there will be a letter R in there, and there will be a letter Z in there and"

Now, of course the numbers are going by pretty quickly, but they can spot the R. They could also spot the Z, if you told them beforehand, just spot the Z and the numbers are moving through at the same rate in both conditions. So what that means is that in every case, you are capable of seeing the R or the Z it's when you try and see both that seeing the first one prevents you from seeing the second one, it's what we call an attentional blink. We do this all the time and people with ADHD tend to have many more attentional blinks than people that don't and this is true for children and for adults. This is an important point. So important that I want to emphasize it twice in case you attentionally blinked. If you see something that you're looking for, or you're very interested in something, you are definitely missing other information in part because you're over focusing on something and this leads to a very interesting hypothesis about what might go wrong in ADHD, where we've always thought that they cannot focus and yet we know they can focus on things they care very much about, well, maybe just maybe they are experiencing more attentional blinks than people who do not have ADHD and indeed, there are data now to support the possibility that that's actually what's happening and that should be exciting to anyone that has ADHD. It should also be exciting to anyone that cares about increasing their focus and their ability to attend. What this is saying is that these circuits, that underlie focus in our ability to attend and our ability to eliminate distraction, they aren't just failing to focus."

Now open monitoring is something that's described in the book that I just referred to and that typically is associated with people who have done a lot of meditation, so called Vipassana meditation, or have spent a lot of time learning how to do what's called open gaze visual analysis and open gaze thinking. But there's a simpler version of this that allows us to bypass all that. First of all, your visual system has two modes of processing. It can be highly focused, a soda straw view. So looking for the R in this string of numbers in the example that I just gave, or if you're very excited about something you're in that soda straw view of the world, and you're missing other things, okay, that's high levels of attention. However, there's also a property of your visual system that allows you to dilate your gaze, to be in so-called panoramic vision. Panoramic vision is something you can do right now, no matter where you are, and I can do it right now, you won't know that I'm doing it, but even though I'm still looking directly at you, I'm consciously dilating my gaze so that I can see the ceiling, the floor and the walls all around me. That panoramic vision is actually mediated by a separate stream or set of neural circuits going from the eye into the brain and it's a stream or set of circuits that isn't just wide angle view. It also is better at processing things in time. Its frame rate is higher. So you've seen slow motion video, and you've seen standard video, slow motion video gives you that slow motion look, because it's a higher frame rate. You're thin slicing time, okay? You can use panoramic vision to access the state that we call open monitoring. When people do that, they are able to attend to and recognize multiple targets within this string of numbers. They can see the R and"

So this is something that can be trained up and people can practice whether or not they have ADHD or not. What involves is learning how to dilate your gaze consciously, that's actually quite easy for most people, whether or not you wear corrective lenses or contacts or not you can consciously go into open gaze and then you can contract your field of view as well. There have also been studies done where people were taught to think in a particular way for a very short period of time, and that forever changed their ability to limit or reduce the number of these attentional blinks. There are now published accounts in the literature of a simple practice done for about 15 minutes, where subjects were asked to just sit quietly eyes closed and do what is sort of akin to meditation, but to not direct their mind into any particular state or place, but simply to think about their breathing and to focus on their so-called interoception, focus on how their body feels, their mind drifted to bring it back, okay? So it's basically meditation for about 15 minutes. That might not seem like a significant or unusual practice or that it would have any impact at all. But remarkably, just doing that once for 17 minutes, significantly reduced the number of attentional blinks that people would carry out. In other words, their focus got better in a near permanent way without any additional training. There's something about that practice of reducing the amount of visual information coming in and learning to pay attention to one's internal state, what we call interoception that allow them an awareness, such that when they needed to look for visual targets, when they need to focus on multiple things in sequence, they didn't experience the same number of attentional blinks and I should mention not incidentally as people age and their working memory gets"

So what these data tell me is that regardless of whether or not you're a child or you're an adult, whether or not you have ADHD or not, whether or not you're experiencing age-related cognitive decline, or you would simply like to avoid age-related cognitive decline, a simple practice of taking 17 minutes sitting and paying attention to your internal state, just interocepting, registering your breathing, registering the contact of your skin with whatever surface you're on, can forever rewire your brain to be able to attend better and possibly even offset some of that age related attentional drift. Now, I don't expect anyone to start meditating regularly. I don't expect anyone to do anything they don't want to do, but I think most of us could handle one meditation's session of 17 minutes or so and so if ever there was a tool that stood to rewire our attentional circuitry in a powerful way. This seems to be it and in addition, the ability to engage in panoramic vision, to dilate our gaze, the so-called open monitoring that allows the brain to function in a way that it can detect more information faster, that's a powerful tool as well and the beauty of that tool is that it works the first time and it works every time.

Now let's talk about actual blinks, the sort that you do with your eyelids. Now, this might come across as somewhat obvious, but you can do fast, what are called spontaneous blinks and they're always coordinated between the two eyes or you can do long blinks like when you go to sleep at night, you do one very long blink, and I'm not being facetious. When you go to sleep at night, you are shutting your eyelids and you are limiting the amount of information coming in and your perception of time starts to drift as you go into sleep. Your perception of time changes from very fast, at one moment to very slow meaning the frame rate at which you are analyzing information dreaming, et cetera, is variable when you were in sleep, sometimes it's very fast. Meaning you experienced things in slow motion. Sometimes it's very fast. In waking to your experience of time can sometimes be very fast sometimes be very slow. Typically the more alert you are, the higher the frame rate, your thin slicing your experience. You've probably had this happen. If you're ever very stressed and you're waiting for something or somebody, it seems like it takes forever because your frame rate is higher you're analyzing time more finely. Conversely, if you are very relaxed or even sleepy, you wake up and you have to think of all the things you have to do. It will seem like the world is going by very, very fast and that you are moving very slow. Time is going at the same rate, but your perception of time is what's changed. Believe it or not. Your perception of time is also changed on a rapid basis. Moment to moment basis by how often you blink. This is a well-established literature in the world of neuroscience that unlike the"

        "source_doc": "by how often you blink. This is a well-established literature in the world of neuroscience that unlike the literature and claims about blinking and sociopathy, which have no basis, the science of blinking as it relates to time perception has some very good data to support it. I want to just emphasize one study in particular, which is quite appropriately titled, \"Time dilates after spontaneous blinking.\" This is a paper that was published in current biology. The first author is Terhune, T-E-R-H-U-N-E. It's a wonderful paper. They examine the relationship between fluctuations in timing and blinking and to make a long story short what they found is that right after blinks, we reset our perception of time, okay? So blinks in that sense are a little bit like the curtain coming down on a scene between scenes in a play or takes in a movie, and they clap the clap thing, they started take in our, what do they say, action and then at the end they do the thing and they click it down and they say, it's a take that's one take when you blink it's a take, okay? Now what's interesting and will immediately make sense to you as to why this is important is that the rate of blinking is controlled by dopamine. So what this means is that dopamine is controlling attention. Blinks relate to attention and focus, and therefore the dopamine and blinking system is one way that you constantly modulate and update your perception of time and fortunately, it's also one that you can control. So the basic takeaway of this study was that blinking controls time perception, but also that levels of dopamine can alter your sense of time and stay with me here, and that blinking and dopamine are inextricably linked. They are working together to control your attention. When dopamine levels go up, people tend to overestimate how long something lasted, why? Because they are processing time more finely it's slow motion mode."

        "source_doc": "how long something lasted, why? Because they are processing time more finely it's slow motion mode. When dopamine levels are lower, they tend to underestimate time intervals. Let's remember back to the very beginning of the episode, what's going on in people with ADHD, they are not good at managing their time, they tend to run late, or they are disorganized. They are not just disorganized in space, meaning in that physical space, around them, they're disorganized in time. Their dopamine is low, we know that as well and so they are underestimating time intervals and so it makes perfect sense that they would be late. It makes perfect sense that they would lose track of time or the ability to focus. This is really exciting because what it means is that children with ADHD, adults, with ADHD or people with normal levels of focus that want to improve their ability to focus can do so through a training that involves learning how often to blink and when, and how to keep their visual focus on a given target and it turns out this study has actually been done. There's a study again, I'll link to the study, entitled \"Improvement of attention in elementary school students through fixation focused training activity.\" I won't go through all the details, but what they found was a short period of focusing on a visual target, allowed the school children to greatly enhance their ability to focus on other types of information and a significant component of the effect was due to the way that they were controlling the shutters on their eyes, their eyelids, and controlling their blinks. So what they did in this study is they had these kids focus their visual attention on some object that was relatively close, like their hand for a minute or so, which actually takes some effort if you try and do that, they were allowed to blink.

It only took a few minutes each day to do this 30 seconds in one condition, or maybe a minute and then at another station of looking a little bit further out and a little bit further out, however, there was an important feature of this study that is definitely worth mentioning, which is before they did this visual focus, task or training, they did a series of physical movements with the kids so that the kids could sort of eliminate or move out some of their desire to move and would thereby enhance their ability to sit still. Now it's long been known that kids need a recess, they need time to run around and play and roll around, do whatever it is that they do in order to be able to sit still at all. Adults probably need this too, frankly, but kids need it more because the circuits in the brain that control reflexive movements and as we say, kind of rhythmic undulating behavior and things like that, that's an active suppression and kids have less of that circuitry built up until they hit about age 15 or 16. So they had the kids move around a bit and then do this focus training. That brings me to another treatment that's actively used nowadays in schools for kids with ADHD,"

So what you will find is that some kids with ADHD are now given a rubber band on their desk, literally a rubber band that's attached to their desk and they're able to pull on it, even snap it against the desk, if I had done that when I was a kid, I think my teachers were throw me out of class, but I think it's great that they're allowing them to do this now as a way of moving some of their physical energy out or engage their physical energy, rather, as opposed to trying to sit statue still all the time and attend and it turns out that does enhance these children's ability to focus mentally when they have some physical activity to attend to and it turns out it also can work for adults. I'll share with you I related anecdote because it illustrates the underlying mechanism. I've had the great privilege of being able to do a number of surgeries, brain surgeries during my career. So one thing you find when you do brain surgeries, is that the brain's pretty small regardless of the species that you're working on and you're in there and you're trying to do something very specific and the more you try and hold your hands really steady, the more they want to shake, all right? So it's not natural for any of our limbs to sit perfectly still, depending on how much coffee you had, how well rested you are and your sort of baseline level of autonomic arousal.

It doesn't mean you're if you're shaking, doesn't mean you're calm if you're still. What it relates to is the amount of what we call premotor activity, the number of commands to move that are being sent through the system and that's what I mean by reverberatory activity and it does seem that kids with ADHD and adults with ADHD have a lot of reverberatory activity in their nervous system and so that's that constant desire to move it's hard for them to sit still and therefore it's hard for them to attend, to harness their attention. When you do a surgery and you find that your hands are shaking, what you learn from your mentors, which I did and what works extremely well, whether or not you're doing a surgery or not, is that you simply tap your foot or you bounce your knee a little bit, which you might think would make your hand shake even more, but provided that it's subtle. What it does is it actually shuttle some of the activity from those premotor circuits to elsewhere in the body and then you're able to sit much more still with your hand, you're able to perform the surgery with much more precision. You are able to write with much better handwriting and for those of you who engage in public speaking, if you ever too nervous, that's why pacing while you public speak helps if you're nervous, that's why bouncing your knee behind the podium works as well. That's why nodding your head and gesticulating can help. It's not a matter of, \"Moving energy out of the body.\" That doesn't actually happen, what it is you're engaging those premotor circuits that are sending through commands.

Now this is sort of a duh, right? But being wide-eyed with excitement or fear or with your eyes, barely being able to keep them open, now it should make perfect sense that these shutters on the front of your eyes, they aren't just there for winking and they aren't just there for cosmetic purposes. They are there to regulate the amount of information going into your nervous system and they're there to regulate how long you are bringing information into your nervous system and in what bins, how widely or finely you are binning time is set by how often you blink and how widely or specifically you are grabbing attention from the visual world is set by whether or not you're viewing things very specifically like a cross area through a soda straw view like this, or whether or not you were in this panoramic sort of whole environment mode, this kind of fisheye lens or wide angle lens mode and in fairness to the pharmacology and the circuitry,"

There's actually a study that's looked at the other neurochemical systems and drugs and how those relate to blinking and so this will all be obvious by the title of the paper I'm about to share with you. This is a paper entitled, \"Decreased spontaneous eyeblink rates in chronic cannabis users, evidence for stride or cannabinoid, dopamine interactions.\" Okay, I'm not going to go into all the details here, but one thing that is somewhat surprising is that many people with ADHD use or abuse cannabis, you might think, well, why would they do that? Because I thought that a increase in dopamine is actually what's going to lead to heightened levels of attention and that's what these people in children crave. Well, it turns out that cannabis also increases dopamine transmission in the brain, but because of the other chemicals, it increases namely serotonin and some components of the cannabinoid and opioid system, it creates that kind of alert, but mellow feel and again, here I'm not a proponent of this, I personally am not a THC or cannabis user. It's just not my thing and obviously it's illegal some places and so you have to determine that for yourself it does have medical purposes in some places it is legal, but THC increases dopamine and increases neurochemicals that can also create a state of calm. So it's that sort of middle ground and this paper has a beautiful demonstration whereby not just while people are using cannabis, but depending on how long they've been using cannabis across their lifespan, the rates of eye blinking change. So if you look at the number of years that people have been using cannabis on a regular basis, either daily or up to excuse me, weekly, or up to daily, what you find is that for people that have not been using cannabis at all, or have only been using it for about two"

Now cannabis has well known effects in depleting memory, but it does seem to engage the focus and blinking system in a way that increases focus.

Something I'd like to discuss just briefly is the so-called interoceptive awareness that's present in people with ADHD, both children and adults. Interoceptive awareness is one sense of one's own internal state heartbeat, breathing contact of skin with a given surface, et cetera. For a long time, there was this hypothesis, this idea that people with ADHD, were just not in touch with how they felt that somehow they weren't registering all the stuff that was going on inside them changes in heart rate and so forth and so they were behaving in a way that was dysregulated or appear dysregulated, and that if they could just learn to attend to their internal state better, that somehow they would function better in the world. Now, before we described a process, literally a 17 minute interoceptive exercise that does seem to lead to improvements in one's ability to focus for a longer period of time. However, it's very unlikely that that was due to increasing interoceptive awareness per se. It probably wasn't because people gain a much heightened or improved ability to understand what's going on internally. In fact, you can imagine how that might actually prevent one's ability to pay attention to things in the outside world. So while there is benefit to just sitting there and being in stillness, as they say, or focusing on one's breathing and internal state for sake of then accessing information in the external world, a really nice study called interoceptive awareness and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder explored whether or not interoceptive awareness was different in people with ADHD or did not have ADHD and the findings were essentially that there's no difference that people with ADHD, children, and adults, they are aware of what's going on inside them just as much as anyone else's and the typical measure of interoceptive awareness is one's ability to count their own heartbeats.

        "source_doc": "ability to count their own heartbeats. This is actually challenging for some individuals and very easy for other individuals, regardless of their attentional capacity. Some people just can really feel their heartbeat without taking their pulse other people cannot and these studies are pretty straightforward to do. You ask people to sit there and to count their heartbeats, and then you are monitoring their heartbeats and you get to gauge how accurate they are. So it's important to understand that people with ADHD are in touch with how they feel. It's really a question of whether or not they can take the demands that are placed upon them and enter a cognitive state of mental state that allows them to access the information they need to access in other words, whether or not they can focus, but it is absolutely wrong to think that the child that's getting up 11 times during a short six minute interaction at the table, or whether or not a child who somehow has to venture off every moment or a coworker of yours who's an adult who's constantly fidgeting or moving things around that somehow they are unaware that they are oblivious, they're not oblivious to how they feel. Chances are they're very challenged in the situations that they're in and they're doing everything they can to try and regulate their attention. So I think it's an important study to highlight because it really underscores the fact that something else is going on and that something else has everything to do with this ability to coordinate these tasks directed networks, and to coordinate that in the proper way with that default mode network and that is a process as you now know, that's regulated exquisitely by certain neurochemicals and in particular the neurochemicals, dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin, and a fourth one I'd like to throw into the mix, which is acetylcholine, which is very vital for cognitive focus. So now I want to switch back to talking about some of the drugs that are typically used"

So before moving to some of the newer atypical compounds and things sold over the counter, I'd like to just briefly return to the classic drugs that are used to treat ADHD. These are the ones I mentioned earlier, methylphenidate also called Ritalin, Modafinil or armodafinil is another one and Adderall, again, all of these work by increasing levels of dopamine and norepinephrine. Typically they're taken orally in pill form, or sometimes in capsule form the dosages that are appropriate vary, according to severity of the condition for a given person and the age of the person. This is a complicated landscape for each individual. They have to figure out the pharmacology that's best for them. Some individuals are even layering long or time to release Ritalin with Adderall in smaller doses, it can get quite complex or it can be quite straightforward if you are really interested in these drugs and how they work and you'd like to get a glance at a table of all the results from all the studies of which there are now hundreds, there's an excellent review about these drugs and their use and their comparison to similarly structured drugs in particular MDMA and cocaine and amphetamine, meaning Street Amphetamine to really illustrate the similarities of action and some of the problems associated with long-term use. I don't expect you to read this article in full I'm here so that you don't have to go read these articles, but in case you want a ton of information, the paper"

It is quite long. I can put a link to that study in our caption, and it essentially describes all the studies that have been done, peer reviewed and published, and it refers to these drugs in an interesting way. It doesn't just refer these drugs as for treatment of ADHD. It actually refers to them using language that ordinarily I'm not very fond of, but I'll agree to here, which is so-called smart drugs or nootropics. It also covers caffeine, which again as I mentioned earlier, increases dopamine norepinephrine and to some extent serotonin, but what I like about this review so much is that in putting, these drugs of abuse, methamphetamine, and cocaine, right alongside these drugs, like Ritalin and Adderall and also caffeine, we start to realize that the distinction between drugs of abuse and the distinction between drugs of treatment is actually a very fine and sometimes even a blurry line and in thinking about whether or not one wants to use these prescription, I want to emphasize prescription, not drugs of abuse, but prescription drugs for treatment of one's own attentional capacity. I think it is important to understand the extent to which they all carry more or less the same side effects. The one exception being caffeine caffeine side effects can be anxiety if you ingest too much of it, insomnia, if you drink it too late in the day, but typically it will not cause the major side effects of the other drugs, such as high propensity for addiction and abuse. Amphetamines of any kind as well as cocaine can cause sexual side effects because they're vasoconstrictors. So, men have trouble"

        "source_doc": "cocaine can cause sexual side effects because they're vasoconstrictors. So, men have trouble achieving erection, there can often be the intense desire or libido for sex, but an inability to actually perform. So that's an issue with any kind of stimulant. So these drugs are not without their consequences. In addition, and here I'd lump caffeine back into the mix. In addition, they almost all carry cardiac effects, right? They increase heart rate, but they also have effects on constriction of blood vessels and arteries and veins and so forth in ways that can create cardiovascular problems. Now, caffeine is a bit of a complicated one. I talked about this on a podcast long ago, but I'll just remind you that it turns out that if you are caffeine adapted, in other words, if you are used to drinking caffeine then the ingestion of caffeine, most often will cause vasodilation who actually allow more blood flow through. However, if you are not caffeine adapted, it will cause vasoconstriction due to an increased stress response. So if you're familiar with caffeine, caffeine can actually have a little bit more of a relaxation response although if you drink enough of it, it will make you amped up. These other drugs, almost always lead to vasoconstriction, increased heart rate dilation of the pupils, less blinking, heightened levels of attention, which looks very much like stress and at its extremes looks very much like the effects of street drugs, like cocaine and amphetamine. Because of the large amounts of dopamine that released in the brain. People tend to crave that state over and over and yet with each subsequent use are able to get less and less of that euphoric feeling or that really, really focused feeling. So one thing that's being explored quite extensively now in the treatment of ADHD are drug schedules. Whether or not people should take"

        "source_doc": "being explored quite extensively now in the treatment of ADHD are drug schedules. Whether or not people should take Adderall every day or every other day, whether or not they should take it only every once in a while, whether or not young children can take it just a few times and engage in behavioral training of the sort that I talked about before, where they're doing, maybe it's a 17 minute meditation type exercise, but more likely it would be the movement followed by the visual focusing, cause that's only done for 20 or 30 or 60 seconds. Why would you do that? Well in a chemically enhanced state, your brain is more plastic. The circuits are able to modify and learn better. That's the optimal time to engage in focus in a very deliberate way. So just taking a drug and expecting focus to just work at any point and being able to turn focus on and off at will, that's an unrealistic expectation, right? More likely the best use of things like Adderall, Modafinil, armodafinil and Ritalin is going to be to combine those treatments with behavioral exercises that actively engage the very circuits that you're trying to train up and enhance and then perhaps I want to highlight perhaps tapering off those drugs so that then one can use those circuits without any need for chemical intervention.

        "source_doc": "So despite any controversy that might be out there, I think it's fair to say that the consumption of omega-3 fatty acids can positively modulate the systems for attention and focus. So then the question becomes how much EPA, how much DHA does that differ for, what's helpful for depression, et cetera and actually it does differ in reviewing the studies for this it appears that a threshold level of 300 milligrams of DHA turns out to be an important inflection point. So typically fish oils or other sources of omega-3s will have DHA and EPA and typically it's the EPA that's harder to get at sufficient levels, meaning you have to take quite a lot of fish oil in order to get above that 1000 milligram or 2000 milligram threshold to improve mood and other functions. But for sake of attention, there are 10 studies that have explored this in detail and while the EPA component is important, the most convincing studies point to the fact that getting above 300 milligrams per day of DHA is really where you start to see the attentional effects. Now, fortunately, if you're getting sufficient EPA for sake of mood and other biological functions, almost without question, you're getting 300 milligrams or more of DHA. So that usually checks that box just fine. What's interesting is that there's another compound phosphatidylserine that has been explored for its capacity to improve the symptoms of ADHD. Again, I don't think this is any direct way, but rather in a modulatory way, but it appears that phosphatidylserine taken for two months for 200 milligrams per day, was able to reduce the symptoms of ADHD in children. It has not been looked at in adults yet as, at least as far as I know, but that this effect was greatly enhanced by the consumption of omega-3 fatty acids. So now"

I carried out for anywhere from one to six months on both boys and girls and it really was boys and girls, not men and women. This was kids age one to six or seven to 12, and it was a fairly large number of subjects. So 147 subjects in one case in 36 in the other, the takeaway is that getting sufficient levels of EPA and particularly there's 300 milligram threshold of DHA, plus, if you are interested in it and it's right for you, 200 milligrams of phosphatidylserine can be an important augment for improving the symptoms of ADHD.

        "source_doc": "So I'd like to talk about the drug Modafinil and the closely related drug armodafinil that's AR Modafinil. Because Modafinil and armodafinil are gaining popularity out there, both for treatment of ADHD and narcolepsy, but also for communities of people that are trying to stay awake long periods of time. So it's actively used in the military by first responders, it's gaining popularity on college campuses and people are using it more and more as an alternative to Adderall and Ritalin and excessive amounts of coffee. It does increase focus and to a dramatic extent, Modafinil typically was very expensive, I don't know if it's still this expensive, but when one has a prescription for it, it could still cost as much as eight or $900 even $1000 a month. Armodafinil is a far less expensive version, that's chemically slightly different than Modafinil. Regardless of price people are taking Modafinil and armodafinil. Want to emphasize that unlike Ritalin and Adderall, Modafinil and armodafinil are weak dopamine re-uptake inhibitors, and that's how they lead to increases in dopamine. So, whereas Ritalin and Adderall, amphetamine, and cocaine lead to big increases in dopamine also through re-uptake mechanisms and so forth Modafinil is a weaker dopamine re-uptake stimulator and so what that means is that it leaves more dopamine around to be active at the synopsis, the gaps between neurons, however, it also activates other systems. It acts on the orexin system, which is actually a peptide that we talked about in the episode on hunger, because it regulates hunger and appetite, and it regulates sleepiness and feelings of sleepiness. In fact, the, excuse me, orexin"

In fact, the, excuse me, orexin also called hypocretin system, the orexin hypocretin system is what's disrupted in narcolepsy. That was the important discovery of my colleagues, Emmanuel Mignot and Seiji Nishino at Stanford some years ago, they identified the biological basis of narcolepsy and it's a disruption in the so orexin hypocretin system and Modafinil is one of the primary treatments for narcolepsy. It also has these other effects on the dopamine system and on the norepinephrine system, even though it doesn't lead to quite as intense levels of dopamine and arousal and focus, it does have the property of raising levels of attention and focus, and that's why people are using it. So it's a somewhat milder form of Adderall. Armodafinil for some people works as well as Modafinil and as I mentioned before, it's much lower cost for other people it doesn't. I have an experience, meaning I do have an experience that I'll share with you with armodafinil. A few years ago, I was suffering from jet lag, really terribly and I was traveling overseas. I went to a meeting to give a talk, I took half of the prescribed dose of armodafinil. It was prescribed to me. I took that half dose and I gave my lecture and then I stayed around to answer questions and then four hours later, a friend of mine came up to me and said, you've been talking for four and a half hours, and they're only a few people still here.

I'm not on any of the compounds that I've described during the course of today's episode. You might ask why I took half the recommended dose of armodafinil and the reason is that I'm somebody who's fairly hypersensitive to medication of any kind, what you find if you look in the literature, is that about 5% of people are hyper hyper sensitive to medication. They require far lower doses of any medication than other people in order to experience the same effects. I'm somebody that I think has, or modest a hyper if that sort of oxymoronic statement, but a modest hypersensitivity to medication.

        "source_doc": "Now you may notice that I haven't talked much about acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that at the neuron to muscle connections, the so called neuromuscular junctions is involved in generating muscular contractions of all kinds for all movements. Acetylcholine is also released from two sites in the brain. So a little bit of nomenclature here again, feel free to ignore the nomenclature, but there is a collection of neurons in your brain stem that send projections forward, kind of like a sprinkler system that's very diffuse to release acetylcholine and those neurons reside in an area or a structure that's called the pedunculopontine nucleus, the PPN and then there's a separate collection of neurons in the basal forebrain called unimaginatively nucleus basalis the nucleus at the base and they also hose the brain with acetylcholine, but in a much more specific way. So one is sort of like a sprinkler system and the other one is more like a fire hose to a particular location and those two sources of acetylcholine, collaborate to activate particular locations in the brain, and really bring about a tremendous degree of focus to whatever is happening at those particular synapses. So it could be a focus on visual information or auditory information, if you're listening closely to what I'm saying right now, and you just heard closely step out from the rest of my sentence, no doubt there was acetylcholine released at the sites in your brain where the neurons that represent your recognition of the word closely occurred, okay? So now you have an example and you have an understanding and hopefully a picture in your mind of how all this is working, not surprisingly then drugs that increase cholinergic or acetycholine transmission will increase focus and cognition.

Typically when people are using alpha-GPC to study or to enhance learning of any kind, they will take somewhere between 300 and 600 milligrams that's more typical. Again, you have to check with your doctor, you have to decide if the safety margins are appropriate for you obviously you'll want to check that out, but alpha-GPC is effective in creating more focused by way of this cholinergic system, It stimulates acetylcholine release from both of those locations, the PPN in the back of the brain and nucleus basalis in the front of the brain.

L-tyrosine does lead to increases in dopamine. They are fairly long lived and L-tyrosine can improve one's ability to focus, however, the dosaging can be very tricky to dial in. Sometimes it makes people feel too euphoric or too jittery or too alert that they are then unable to focus well. So the dosage ranges are huge, you see evidence for 100 milligrams all the way up to 1200 milligrams. It's something that really should be approached with caution, especially for people that have any kind of underlying psychiatric or mood disorder, because dysregulation of the dopamine system is central to many of the mood disorders such as depression, but also especially mania bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, things of that sort. So it's something that really should be approached with caution, nonetheless, in exploring what's out there and even some studies online that were done in either animal studies or human studies, it's clear that L-tyrosine is being explored for that purpose as is PEA and Phenethylamine, which is a essentially PEA, but some related compounds. So there's a whole class of dopaminergic or dopamine stimulating supplements that people are using to try and get their dopamine levels up and again, it's kind of a fine line between too little enough and too much.

They are gray market in other countries, and they are sold over the counter in this country, in the U.S. so they have different margins for safety you definitely need to consult your doctor, especially if you have ADHD, but new pepped has been shown when taken, at 10 milligrams, twice daily can be more effective than some of the other Racetams. What is Noopept? Noopept taps into the cholinergic system, the acetylcholine system in ways, very similar to alpha-GPC, but seems to have a slightly higher affinity for some of the receptors involved and can lead to those heightened states of cognitive capacity and there are these studies one in particular, comparative studies of new pepped, Racetams in the treatment of patients with mild cognitive disorders and brain diseases of vascular and traumatic origin. That's a mouthful. What this study basically points to is the fact that people who are experiencing some degree of inability to focus due to prior concussion or some vascular event, a stroke or a schemey of any kind, because neurons need blood, when the blood supply is cut off to neurons, or when there's a bleed in the brain. Subsequent to that, often there are challenges in maintaining focus. This is very common for people who have done sports, where there's a lot of running into each other with your head like rugby football, hockey, and so forth, but also people who have experienced head blows or often overlooked is the fact that most traumatic head injury is not actually from sports, even football it's from things like construction work from"

Again, you have to figure out if it's right for you, but they are beginning to show some promise, and I'm intrigued by them because of the way that they tap into the cholinergic system, which is both directly involved in focus, and the ability to focus, but is also important for things related to age-related cognitive decline. So a decline in cholinergic transmission or acetylcholine as we call it in the brain is one of the things associated with cognitive decline and it does seem that increasing cholinergic transmission can offset some of that cognitive decline and perhaps even more so in conditions such as vascular damage or concussion to the brain. If you're interested in atypical treatments for ADHD compounds or improve focus and related themes, and you like reading about this stuff, there's an excellent review article that I can refer you to it's by Ahn et al, AHN it was published in 2016 so it's a little bit behind the times, although it's surprisingly comprehensive given that, which lines up all the various drugs that I've discussed, Racetams., and Adderall and Ritalin, and various forms of dopaminergic agents and cholinergic agents spells out whether or not they are sold over the counter by prescription, and really lines them up in all their effects, their drawbacks, et cetera.

It can direct the activity of particular brain regions at particular depths and as I mentioned, it can increase or decrease that activity. So for instance, I've had a TMS coil placed on my head, not for therapeutic purposes, even it was, I wouldn't tell you, but rather just for, well, I'm a neuroscientist and I worked in a lab with one for entertainment, exploratory purposes, please don't do this at home. It was placed over my motor cortex, which generates voluntary action and it was a coil that at that time could only inhibit neurons and so what I was doing as I was moving objects around on a table, just like I am now, it was actually a pencil, not a pen and I was tapping the pencil and then the TMS coil was turned on and for the life of me, I could not move that pencil, okay? Because it was inhibiting my upper motor neurons in the portion of my cortex that controls voluntary activity. As soon as the"

        "source_doc": "my upper motor neurons in the portion of my cortex that controls voluntary activity. As soon as the coil was turned off, I could return to tapping the pencil again, nowadays it's possible to stimulate motor cortex or any area of the brain with some degree of precision that could create the impulse to move without actually making the decision to move. So you can literally engage certain neural circuits and therefore behaviors and certain thought and emotional patterns by way of transcranial magnetic stimulation. This has far reaching and vast implications, as you can probably imagine in discussing ADHD with a colleague that uses TMS, what they are doing is they are taking the TMS coil to children and adults that have ADHD, and they're using it to stimulate the portions of the prefrontal cortex that we talked about earlier that engage task directed focused states. So rather than using a drug that generally increases dopamine, and some of the other chemicals involved there you using directed TMS stimulation of the circuits and fortunately, I was quite relieved to hear this, they are combining that with a focused learning task. So they're literally teaching the brain to learn in a noninvasive way, no drug at all and right now there are experiments clinical trials going on, comparing TMS of this sort to the drug treatments of the sort that we described earlier that engaged these circuits through pharmacologic mechanisms. So very exciting times for TMS, very exciting times for pharmacology related to ADHD and for enhancing focus in general and when I say very exciting times, I mean, no drug is perfect, but the constellation of drugs that's out there is getting much larger, but because they tap into different aspects of their circuitry, I do think that we are well on our way to identifying the ideal combinations of drug treatments, technological treatments, and behavioral paradigms for increasing focus in both children and adults with ADHD.

        "source_doc": "And as a final final point, I also want to mention something about technologies that are making it harder for all of us to focus, regardless of whether or not we have pre-existing ADHD or not. You can probably guess where this is going. Everybody nowadays seems to have a smartphone. I'm sure there are a few individuals out there that don't have a smartphone. Nonetheless, most people have them. Most kids want one, as soon as they can get them and they are small, they grab our attention entirely. But within that small box of attention, there are millions of attentional windows scrolling by, right? So just because it's one device that we look at does not mean that we are focused, we are focused on our phone, but because of the way, in which context switches up so fast within the phone, it's thought that the brain is struggling now to leave that rapid turnover of context, right? Many, many shows, many, many Instagram pages, many, many Twitter feeds many, many websites. Basically the whole world, at least in virtual format is available within that small box. Unlike any other technology humans have ever dealt with before, even though there are trillions infinite number of bits of information in the actual physical world, your attentional window, that aperture of constriction and dilating that visual window is the way in which you cope with all that overwhelming information typically. Well within the phone, your visual aperture is set to a given width it's about this big, typically the phone seem to be getting bigger, but nonetheless, it's about that big and within there, your attentional window is grabbing it near infinite number of bits of information, colors, movies. If a picture is worth 1000 words, a movie is worth a billion pictures, the brain loves visual motion and so the question is, does that sort of interaction on a regular basis lead to deficits in the types of attention that we"

There are some studies and one in particular that I'd like to highlight one was actually carried out pretty early in 2014. This is a study that explored smartphone use at the time they called it mobile phone use, but smartphone use and inattention, difficulties in attending in 7,102 adolescents that's a huge study, a population based cross-sectional study and you will be probably surprised and somewhat dismayed to hear that in order to avoid this decrease in attentional capacity, adolescents needed to use their smartphone for less than 60 minutes per day, in order to stay focused and centered on their other tasks. Otherwise they started to really run into significant issues. So 60 minutes is not much, I've a feeling that most young people are using their phone more than 60 minutes per day, I know I am. I think for adults, the number's probably higher meaning if you're an adult, I'm going to just extrapolate from what I read in this study. It seems that probably two hours a day on the phone would be the upper limit beyond which you would probably experience pretty severe attentional deficits. I'm a big fan of Cal Newport who wrote the book \"Deep work.\" He's also written an excellent book, \"A world without Email.\" I've never met him, but I'm a huge admirer of his work and I will paraphrase something that he said far more eloquently than I ever"

        "source_doc": "And typically when people ask about or talk about ultradian rhythms, they are referring to 90-minute rhythms. I've talked about these on the podcast before. And Jackson's question was-- how do you use ultradian rhythms in your daily work? There's more to the question, but first off, I do use ultradian rhythms-- that is, I leverage the fact that these do exist in all of us as a way to engage in focused bouts of mental work once or twice, or sometimes three times per day. However, I use them in a way that's grounded in the research on ultradian rhythms for learning and memory in a way that might not be obvious just from their name that they are 90-minute rhythms. So I'll get into the details of how to use ultradian rhythms to best capture neuroplasticity-- that is the brain's ability to change in response to experience-- and in a way that should allow you to get one or two, or maybe even three focused bouts of learning per day, which can greatly accelerate learning of cognitive material, languages, mathematics, history-- for sake of school or work, or maybe just a hobby, or a personal interest of some sort-- and for skill learning in the physical domain as well. Jackson then went on to ask-- you've mentioned before that you try to include at least one 90-minute focus block per day as part of your work and overall mission. And indeed, that is true. I tried to get at least one of these focused ultradian rhythm blocks per day. That is a period of about 90 minutes"

        "source_doc": "That is a period of about 90 minutes where I'm focused on learning something or doing something that's cognitively hard, although typically I aim for two of these sessions per day. He then goes on to ask-- what is the maximum number of blocks you can perform sustainably? The answer to that is probably four. And I say probably because some people have schedules, lifestyles, in which four 90-minute blocks of focused learning is possible per day, but that's highly unusual. For most people, it's going to be one or two, maybe three-- four, I would place in the really extraordinary end of things, maybe if you're cramming for exams or you've managed to go on a writing retreat or a learning and retreat of some sort where you can devote essentially, all of your non-sleeping, non-eating time to learning. But most people simply can't organize their life that way. So the short answer is-- for me, it's one or two per day is the target and three would be the maximum. You then went on to ask-- do you take vacations or extended breaks from these ultradian rhythm sessions? And the short answer is no. Typically, I try and do this every day-- and yes, even on the weekends. But on the weekend, the ultradian rhythm focused learning bout might just be reading a book for about 90 minutes or so, which might not be as cognitively difficult as it is for other sorts of work that I perform during the week. I occasionally miss a day entirely for whatever reason-- travel, obligations related to family, et cetera. But in general, I try and do this every day."

But essentially, that accessing the circuits for focus is made easier by accessing them regularly and that's because the circuits for focus are indeed themselves amenable to neuroplasticity. In other words, the more you force yourself to focus, the easier focusing gets. I'll now answer the last part of the question and then I will go through and emphasize some tools that anyone can use in order to leverage ultradian rhythms toward learning bouts-- either cognitive learning or physical skill learning, or a combination of the two. The last part of the question Jackson asked was-- if you knew you needed to drastically increase the amount of focus you do daily, how would you schedule that focus and recover from it? That's an excellent aspect to this question. And I will now give you the details of how I would use and schedule ultradian rhythms. I'll offer you a tool-- I've never talked about this tool in the Huberman Lab podcast.

Indeed, even during sleep, we are experiencing and more or less governed by these ultradian rhythms. This question and this answer is not so much about sleep. But just know that when you go to sleep at night until you wake up in the morning, every 90 minutes or so, your patterns of sleep-- that is the percentage or ratio rather of slow wave sleep to light sleep to rapid eye movement sleep changes in a way such that each 90-minute cycle gates the next cycle. It flips on switch for the next 90-minute cycle then that 90-minute cycle ends, flips on switch for the next one, and so on and so forth. I mentioned all that because during the daytime, the same thing is true. But most people don't know when the 90-minute all trading cycles begin. Because if you think about it, you could wake up on the basis of an alarm clock or noise in the room, or simply because you naturally wake up in the middle of an ultradian 90-minute cycle. So does that mean, for instance, that if you wake up 60 minutes into an ultradian cycle that the next 30 minutes of your waking-- right, because that 60 minutes needs to continue to 90 to complete an ultradian cycle-- that the next 30 minutes after waking are related to the ultradian cycle that you were still in during sleep, or does it start a new ultradian cycle.

Can I just set a clock and work for 90 minutes?\" And the short answer is no. And that might seem unfortunate, but the good news is that you can figure out when your first proper ultradian cycle of the day begins simply by asking yourself when are you most alert after waking. That is if you were, say to wake up at 7:00 AM and let's say that's the end of an ultradian cycle or perhaps you're in the middle of an ultradian cycle-- doesn't matter. What you need to watch for or pay attention to for a day or so is when you start to experience your greatest state of mental alertness in the morning. And here, we can discard with all the issues and variables around caffeine or no caffeine, hydrating or no hydrating. Exercise is one variable that we'll consider in a moment. But here's the deal-- these all trading in cycles are actually triggered by fluctuations in the so-called glucocorticoid system-- the system that regulates cortisol release. And as some of you have probably heard me say before-- cortisol, even though it's often discussed as a terrible thing, it's chronic stress, cortisol, cortisol, et cetera-- cortisol is essential for health and every day we get a rise in cortisol in the morning that is associated with enhanced immune function, enhanced alertness, enhanced ability to focus, so on and so forth.

How can I say about if it's indeed a 90-minute cycle? Well, this is really where the underlying neurobiology in these ultradian cycles converge to give you a specific protocol. The changes in cortisol that occur throughout the day involve-- yes, a big peak early in the day if you're getting your sunlight and caffeine and maybe even some exercise early in the day. But typically, that peak comes early. And then across the day the baseline jitters a little bit, it comes down, but it bounces around a little bit. It's not a flat line, if we were to measure your glucocorticoid levels. Each one of those little bumps corresponds to a shift in these ultradian cycles. So if you find that you are most alert at 9:30 or starting to become alert at 9:30, and then typically you have a peak of focus and concentration around 10:00 AM, that is really valuable to know. Because the way that the molecules that control neuroplasticity-- that is the changes in neurons and other cell types in the brain that allow your nervous system to learn and literally for new connections to form between neurons, which is basically the basis of learning-- those fluctuate according to these ultradian cycles.

        "source_doc": "This is where there's a lot of confusion out there, people think, oh, ultradian cycles are 90 minutes, therefore, we should be in our peak level of focus throughout that 90 minutes. In reality, most people take about 10 or 15 minutes to break into a really deep trench of focus and then periodically throughout the next hour, they'll pop out of that focus, now have to deliberately refocus. This is why, if possible, you want to turn off Wi-Fi connections and put your phone in the other room or turn it off. If. You do need your phone or Wi-Fi, just be aware of how distracting those things can be to getting into a deep trench of focus. But the point is this-- these 90-minute cycles occur periodically throughout the day, but there is going to be one period early in the day-- and here, I'm referring to the spirit of starting at about 9:30 or 10:00 AM-- and then likely another one in the mid to late afternoon that are going to be ideal for focused learning. And that focus learning bout should ideally have you set your clock-- a stopwatch or something-- to measure 90 minutes, but do assume that there's going to be some jitter at the front end where you're not going to be able to focus as deeply as you would like. Then you'll get about an hour of deep focus and then you really start to transition out of these ultradian cycles. How do when the afternoon ultradian cycle occurs?"

I wish I could tell you it's going to be 2 PM or it's going to be 3:00 PM-- that's really going to depend on the individual. When you ingest caffeine, some of the other demands of your day. But you can learn to recognize when these two periods for optimized learning will occur and here are the key principles. Watch for a day or two-- meaning pay attention to when you have your peak levels of physical and mental energy in the morning-- that is between waking and noon, and then again between noon and about 6:00 or 7:00 PM. Although I'm sure that there are some late shifted folks that will experience their peak in focus somewhere around 6:00 or 7:00 PM, especially if they're waking up around 10:00 or 11:00 AM, as I know some people out there are. Once you know where those peaks in focus occur on your schedule, set a stopwatch for one ultradian cycle in the early part of the day. In this example, I was saying 9:30, but if you can't hop on it until 10, that's fine. Set it for 90 minutes, consider that block wholly-- meaning rule out all other distractions.

So if you're trying to learn something,"

        "source_doc": "So if you're trying to learn something, really capture it during that phase as well. Now, is there a third opportunity or a fourth opportunity? This relates to Jackson's question directly. And the short answer is not really, unless you're somebody who requires very little sleep. Within the 12 or 16 hours that one tends to be awake during the day or 18 hours that one tends to be awake, there are really only two of these major peaks in the glucocorticoid system that trigger the onset of the circadian cycles. Again, there's a ramping up and a ramping down of glucocorticoids throughout the day. But the real key here is to learn when you tend to be most focused based on your regular sleep, wake cycle, caffeine intake, exercise, et cetera. And again, that's going to vary from person to person. And you really only have two opportunities or two ultradian cycles to capture in order to get the maximum focus challenging work done a.k.a. learning. So for somebody that wants to learn an immense amount of material or who has the opportunity to capture another ultradian cycle, the other time where that tends to occur is also early days. So some people by waking up early and using stimulants like caffeine and hydration or some brief high-intensity exercise, can trigger that cortisol pulse to shift a little bit earlier so that they can capture a morning work block that occurs somewhere, let's say between 6:00 and 7:30 AM. So let's think about our typical person-- at least in my example that's waking up around 7:00 AM. And then I said, has their first ultradian work cycle really flip on because that bump"

If that person were say to set their alarm clock for 5:30 AM, then get up, get some artificial light-- if the sun isn't out, turn on bright or artificial lights, or if the sun happens to be up that time of year, get some sunlight in your eyes. But irrespective of sunlight, were to get a little bit of brief high intensity"

        "source_doc": "to get a little bit of brief high intensity exercise maybe 10 or 15 minutes of skipping rope or even just Jumping Jacks or go out for a brief jog, what happens then is the cortisol pulse starts to shift earlier. And so the next day and the following day and so on and so forth-- provided they're still doing that exercise first thing and ideally getting some light in their eyes as well-- well then they have an opportunity to capture an increase in cortisol that is now shifted from about 7:00 AM to about 8:30 AM. So they can capture an hour of work there and then they will also still be within that rising phase of cortisol in the 9:30 to 10:00 AM block that lasts until about 11:30 or so. They might have lunch. Perhaps after lunch, they do a Non-Sleep Deep Rest-- maybe they, don't maybe you're a napper or maybe you're not-- doesn't really matter. And then in the afternoon-- and I would suspect it would now be in the earlier afternoon sometime around 2:00 or 2:30 would be typical. Although again, that exact time will vary person to person. Then they would want to schedule another 90-minute work block. So that's how you can capture three. Now you can start to see also why capturing four ultradian work blocks would be exceedingly rare. It's just not typical that people are awake for that much of the day, you have to sleep at some point. And I should mention that if you're going to force yourself to wake up earlier on a consistent basis, you probably should be trying to get to sleep a little bit earlier as well."

Because it's not just the quality, but the duration of quality sleep that really matters for learning. And I should also remind everybody that the actual rewiring of neurons does not occur during any focused work block, it actually occurs during deep sleep the following night and the following night, and during Non-Sleep Deep Rest. This is why Non-Sleep Deep Rest can accelerate learning because it's in states of rest that the actual connections between neurons strengthen or weaken or new neurons are added in a way that allows for what we call learning. OK. So one or two all trading work blocks per day is typical,"

        "source_doc": "So one or two all trading work blocks per day is typical, three would be really exceptional, and four would be extraordinary. Look for them-- meaning look to see when you are feeling most focused and alert typically in the period before waking and noon and typically in the period between noon and bedtime, given your standard intake of caffeine and exercise and other life events. Please also remember that even though it's an ultradian 90-minute work block, the neuroplasticity is going to be best triggered within a 60-minute portion of that. And there's no way to know exactly when that 60 minutes begins and ends until you actually begin the work block. So this is really designed to be empirical, you need to actually go do this. What you'll notice again is that it's hard to focus at first then you'll drop into a state of focus. You may get distracted, that's perfectly normal. You refocus, get back into triggering learning-- that's really what you're doing, you're triggering learning-- and then there'll be some taper and then you'll be out of the ultradian work block. Now, it's also a key to understand that myself and other people should not expect that they're only working during these 90-minute work blocks. It's just that a lot of the sorts of demands of our day, including cooking and shopping for groceries, and email, and text messaging, and social media-- a lot of those things don't require intense focus of the sort that I believe Jackson is asking about maximizing, and that I'm referring to when I talk about these ultradian work blocks.

So if you are somebody who's really interested in improving your fitness and your fitness requires a lot of focused attention-- so for instance, when I go out for a long run on Sundays, which is part of my fitness routine, I deliberately not thinking about much, I'm just trying to cruise along. I might focus a little bit on my pace in stride, maybe an audiobook I'm listening to or a podcast. But typically, I'm just cruising along, it's low cognitive demand work. These ultradian work blocks can really be maximized for pure cognitive work-- book type work, et cetera, music, et cetera, or they can also be leveraged toward skill learning. So if you're trying to learn how to dance or how to perform a particular athletic move or you're trying to get better at some skill that requires a lot of focus and alignment of muscular movement and cognitive demands, et cetera, well then these are also going to be ideal for triggering neuroplasticity to get better in the motor skill based domain as it's called, et cetera.

It's a vast literature and one that I'd be happy to teach you in a standard podcast episode. But in the interest of getting to more questions from you all, hopefully the answer I've given you now has been complete enough, yet clear enough, and yet succinct enough that you can start to leverage these really powerful aspects of iterative metaplasticity and ultradian rhythms for learning. And I'd just like to point out that these opportunities for focused learning that occur in these 90-minute ultradian cycles are really terrific opportunities. They are offered to you at least twice every day and you can really learn to detect when they occur and when they're likely to occur. You can certainly learn at other times in the 24-hour cycle. But for anyone who's tried to stay up late at night cramming for an exam or for somebody who's tried to learn during the sleepiest time of their afternoon, we can be very familiar with the fact that there are times of day in which we are best at learning. And as I've just described, there are ways to capture those moments and they are valuable moments.

First of all, it's to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which of course, will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length. We are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast. And to fund research-- in particular, research done on human beings. So not animal models, but on human beings, which I think we all agree is the species that we are most interested in. And we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance. And those protocols will be distributed through all channels. Not just the premium channel, but through all channels-- Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. So the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now an especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the Tiny Foundation has generously offered to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel.

The person asks about the role of sunlight, the role of calming sounds, the role of observing wildlife, of observing green colors, and, quote, \"other stuff.\" And in fact, I'm glad that they asked about \"other stuff\" because I get the question about the scientifically-supported benefits of nature a lot. I often also get the question about grounding. For those of you that aren't familiar with what grounding is, grounding is a practice of putting your feet on the Earth directly with bare feet, oftentimes into soil or on a lawn. And it's a question that I seem to get more and more. In fact, every week for quite a long while now, on social media or elsewhere, somebody asks me about the scientific support for this practice of grounding. So obviously there's a lot of interest in what the scientific research says about getting into nature and putting one's feet on the ground, a.k.a. grounding, and so on. OK, so if I'm going to answer this question, I first have to be very direct with you. There is excellent, meaning dozens, if not hundreds, of quality peer-reviewed studies which support the value of getting sunlight in one's eyes, in particular early in the day to set your circadian rhythm. This is something that I've talked about extensively on the Huberman Lab podcast and as a guest on other podcasts. It's one of the first and, frankly, most important items on the toolkit for sleep, which is a zero-cost toolkit that you can access by going to hubermanlab.com, going to the menu, going to Newsletter. You can see it as a PDF there. You don't have to sign up"

        "source_doc": "going to Newsletter. You can see it as a PDF there. You don't have to sign up for the newsletter. You can just access that toolkit for sleep. And you'll notice that very close to the top of that list, if not top of that list, is to get sunlight in your eyes early in the day. You don't have to see the sun cross the horizon. If you can, that's great. But if you wake up after the sun has already risen, go outside, face the sun, blink as necessary to protect your eyes, but get some sunlight into your eyes every single day or as often as you possibly can, especially on overcast days. That's an absolutely unequivocally science-supported tool that will increase daytime mood, focus, and alertness and will improve your nighttime sleep. Viewing morning sunlight also has profoundly positive effects on metabolism. Now, those effects on metabolism could be the direct effect of viewing sunlight or, more likely, they are the indirect consequence of getting better sleep at night. So getting sunlight in your eyes early in the day and ideally in the evening or late afternoon before the sun sets is a very well supported protocol that we know is beneficial for numerous aspects of mental health, physical health, and performance. And of course, sunlight and getting sunlight in one's eyes"

        "source_doc": "And of course, sunlight and getting sunlight in one's eyes does require that you get outside. You simply will not derive the same benefits from viewing sunlight if you try and do it through a window or windshield or if you look at a picture of a sun on a screen. Forget it. You are not going to set your circadian rhythm. You are not going to derive all the positive effects of sunlight by trying to get it from screens or from looking at pictures of suns or something of that sort. Now, if you are somebody that, for whatever reason-- seasonality, where you live on the planet, work schedule, et cetera-- who cannot get sunlight in your eyes early in the day on a consistent basis, well, then you might consider purchasing a so-called SAD lamp, which is for seasonal affective disorder, which is very bright light that you can look at in the morning for usually about 5 to 10 minutes. People will put it on their counter while they make their morning coffee, eat their breakfast. And that has also been shown to improve mood, focus, and alertness and set one's circadian rhythm. But it is not nearly as effective as getting sunlight in your eyes. Now, why am I talking about this practice that I've already talked about extensively on numerous podcasts before? Well, because the question is about nature, and sunlight is a key feature of our natural environment. But the person is also asking about other features of nature-- seeing green colors, or blue colors, or running streams for that matter. Well, here, too, we can ask, what does the scientific data really say about things like going near a waterfall, or a running stream, or being near an ocean? And actually, this is"

There is actually a peer-reviewed literature on negative ionization, as it's called, which is a pattern of ionization that's present close to bodies of water and particular types of bodies of water, such as waterfalls, running streams, et cetera. There's actually a laboratory at Columbia University School of Medicine that has published fairly extensively on the health benefits of negative ionization as it relates to setting circadian rhythm and some other aspects of mental and physical health. I intend to host the head of that laboratory on the Huberman Lab podcast in the not too distant future. For now, we can safely say this-- there does seem to be some positive health benefits to placing oneself near bodies of water, in particular moving bodies of water. And of course, as is always the case when there's a discovery about how the natural world can impact health, there have been some technologies developed to create negative patterns of ionization within a home environment. But as with viewing sunlight exposure and comparing it to, say, SAD lamps, the negative ionization machines that one can purchase and put in their home environment have been shown in a few studies to produce some positive health benefits. But those positive effects in no way reach the level of positive effects that have been demonstrated in studies where people are actually spending a dedicated period of time outdoors as near a moving body of water.

        "source_doc": "So in thinking about nature, natural environments, there's strong evidence for getting sunlight in one's eyes. There is some evidence for being near moving bodies of water, perhaps-- again, I really want to highlight perhaps-- because of negative ionization created by those moving bodies of water. There is far less evidence for sunlight simulators or negative ionization machines used indoors. And then the asker of this question also, quite correctly, asked about things like calming sounds, watching wildlife, green colors, et cetera. And herein lies a really important point for everyone to digest. While, of course, answering a question about the natural world or about health requires that we first pose a hypothesis-- for those of you that aren't familiar what a hypothesis is, a hypothesis is a stated prediction. So it's not a question. A question would be something like, is getting out into nature good for our health? A scientific hypothesis is where one actually takes a stance. For instance, you could take the stance and make the hypothesis that getting out into nature for 30 minutes per day, three days per week, improves mood and nighttime sleep. So that's a hypothesis that then one would go on to design an experiment to test and then evaluate the data from that experiment and compare it to the hypothesis, either validating or negating that hypothesis. That's essentially how science is done. There's a lot more to it, but that's essentially the scientific method. And while, of course, the scientific method is a fabulously powerful tool, for some questions, it is a less potent tool. And the question of is getting out into nature helpful for enhancing our mental and physical health is the sort of question that while ideally you could design a really well controlled study to address,"

And here's why. In order to perform a study that's very well controlled, meaning where you can isolate individual variables-- like sunlight, like the sorts of color contrast that one sees in a natural scene outdoors in a forest or near a river-- in order to address whether or not the calming sounds or the presence of squirrels running through your environment are the relevant factors, it becomes incredibly difficult to try and isolate individual variables, meaning as soon as you bring people into the laboratory, yes, you have more control over which variables, as they're called, you present them, by bringing them into a room that essentially has no art on the walls and then having them look at a picture of a sun or looking at sunlight or listening to soothing sounds or looking at a picture of a forest, of course, you're controlling the individual variables. However, there is a sort of gestalt, meaning a collective picture of being in nature that brings together lots of different elements-- the element of surprise, for instance."

        "source_doc": "for instance. The other day I was out for a Sunday hike, and that morning I saw a squirrel running across my path, and it was interesting because the squirrel had a pinecone in its mouth. It had been chewed down to the cob. And the squirrel was probably only about 7 or 8 inches long, and the pine cone was probably about 9 or 10 inches long-- the cob of the pine cone, that is. And the interesting thing is that the squirrel was carrying it long ways from the tip of the cob. And so I delighted in the fact that this little squirrel was working so hard to carry this object through the woods. And this object was literally longer than its own body length, and it looked so dedicated in its running across the path in order to do whatever it would with that pine cone cob. So something like that obviously stuck in my memory. It delighted me. And at the very same time, there were a number of other things happening besides the presence of that novel wildlife experience. There was the sound of a stream. There's the sunlight. There's the color contrast everywhere. I'm breathing fresh air because I was far away from any cars or any civilization, in fact. And so here's what we know. There are dozens, if not hundreds, of studies that show that if people get out of doors into nature-- this could be parks. This could be near a stream. This could be an ocean, any number of different natural environments. And if they do that for anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes, three to seven days per week, indeed there are demonstrated significant reductions in things like blood pressure, resting heart rate, improvements in sleep, improvements in mood. And so I think we can very reliably say that, yes,"

And so I think we can very reliably say that, yes, or perhaps even absolutely yes, getting outside into nature can enhance various aspects of mental health, physical health, and thereby performance in different aspects of life. However, when talking about the benefits of getting into nature, we are talking about hundreds, if not thousands, of variables, some of which we are aware of, such as the presence of wildlife or sunlight or color contrast. And then, of course, there are going to be dozens, if not hundreds, maybe even thousands of other variables that we're not even aware of. Perhaps it's negative ionization. Most people aren't measuring the ionization of the air when they go out into nature. But perhaps it's also the presence of certain smells from the soils that are being broken down and then they're changing the oxygenation state of the air around you, the plants, et cetera. Again, so many variables, that, frankly, to try and isolate any one of those variables in the laboratory seems not just artificial, but I think that it actually would just lead to a diminished sense of just how valuable nature is. So while, of course, the Huberman Lab podcast is a podcast where we always center on science and science-related tools, meaning protocols that are grounded in quality peer-reviewed studies that have been subjected to control conditions where some people are getting, say, the drug treatment or taking the supplement or doing a particular behavioral practice and other people are not or doing some variant of those and dose response curves, all of that stuff, when it comes to the question of whether or not it's valuable to get out into nature, I think it's a very straightforward yes. Absolutely yes. Get out into nature as often as you"

Some people are in deserts. Some people are near the ocean. But getting out into nature has been shown over and over again to have numerous positive health effects. And yet, unless we're talking about sunlight exposure and isolating the variable of setting one's circadian rhythm by viewing sunlight early in the day, all of the other features of getting out into nature, things like forest bathing-- this is a term coined from some, frankly, pretty nice studies that were done in Japan in which people placed themselves into forest-like environments for a certain period of time. There were control groups where people were not placed into those environments, and the people that did this so-called forest bathing experienced enhanced mental and physical health. That brought on a practice of people who could not get out of doors into forests bringing plants into their home environment, which I think all of us would agree look nice. They often will add pleasant odors to the air, and perhaps they do actually shift our mental and physical health in significant ways. I suppose it depends on how much you like plants, how much you pay attention to them, and, of course, how many plants there are. But-- and I think this is a really important \"but\" to emphasize-- while most all questions about tools and protocols for enhancing health immediately lead me to say, ah, this study or that study or, yes, there's evidence or, no, there isn't evidence, when it comes to questions about nature and grounding in particular, I take the stance that this is a unique instance where we know there are just so many benefits of getting out into nature that trying"

Now, I'm sure there are some of you out there who are aware-- and if you're not, I'll tell you-- there are studies that have explored this practice of so-called grounding. They've had people come into the laboratory and place their feet on soil that is contained within a box or there are other studies where they actually have people go out of doors and place their feet onto the grass or the ground. And there are a bunch of theories as to how grounding could improve one's mental and physical health that aren't just about getting outside. So the theories go that this has to do with the exchange of electrons with the Earth and the Earth's surface in particular. There's been the argument made that shoes, in particular shoes that have rubber soles, may block some of this electron exchange with the surface of the Earth. There have been theories about the tactile-- that is, the touch sensation-- with the Earth being important. Not a lot of science published in, let's just say, blue ribbon journals, which is not to diminish some of the journals that these have been published in, but just to say that, again, there are so many variables associated with a practice such as grounding that I'll simply say, yes, please do get out of doors into nature.

Now, I also try to get out of doors other days of the week. But oftentimes, I'm, by way of weather or by way of other commitments, forced to be indoors, on planes, here at the podcast studio where certainly I'm indoors. But I try and get out of doors at least a few minutes each day for a morning stroll, looking at sunlight, et cetera. So the long and short of this is, yes, there's some evidence for grounding. Is it super strong evidence? No, it's not. We don't really know what it is about placing one's feet onto the Earth that is producing the positive effects that were observed in those studies. And those studies made some reasonable attempt to isolate the variables and figure out whether or not it was ion exchange with the Earth or the tactile, meaning the touch sensation, of having one's feet on the ground. Frankly, I don't think there's enough quality science to really draw any firm conclusions about that. However, if you like the idea of grounding, by all means, do it.

Definitely don't do this at the dog park. Hookworm is a real thing, by the way, folks. So pay attention to the sorts of surfaces that you're putting your feet onto. But the question about whether or not nature is valuable for our mental and physical health is an easy one. It's an absolute yes. But isolating the particular variables about nature that are most beneficial, well, that's a much tougher question, and it's one that, frankly, the scientific method is not and, to be honest, I don't think ever will be in a position to isolate and really nail down specifically, because as soon as you get specific about that question, you start to diminish the value of the study itself. So the long and short of this is get out into nature as often as you safely can. If you can exercise out of doors, even better. If you want to make it social, great. If you don't want to make it social, fine. It's your life. It's up to you. But there certainly is value in getting out into nature.

And frankly, I don't have a scientific explanation for why nature is oh-so beneficial, except for the sunlight piece and perhaps this grounding piece and the negative ionization piece. And frankly, I don't worry so much about the lack of variable-isolating, quality, peer-reviewed studies that support the benefits of getting out into nature. I simply like getting out into nature and into different natural environments as much as I possibly can, because, for whatever reason, imagine those reasons have something to do with serotonin, dopamine, hormones, oxytocin, probably a bunch of different things that are rooted in how our nervous system evolved in natural environments.

And those protocols will be distributed through all channels, not just the premium channel, but through all channels, Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. So the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the Tiny Foundation has generously offered to do dollar-for-dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel. So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science-related tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to sign up for the Huberman Lab Premium channel, again, there's a cost of $10 per month, or you can pay $100 up front for the entire year. That will give you access to all the AMAs. You can ask questions and get answers to your questions. And you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well.

It's something that plagues many people. That is, a lot of people have challenges with task switching. It's also a topic that people will often confuse with cognitive flexibility. All of us, unless it's been removed, have an area of our brain called the prefrontal cortex. The words prefrontal cortex actually refers to a fairly varied real estate within the human brain. It's not one area of the human brain. Prefrontal cortex actually includes a lot of different subdivisions that do different things in the context of cognition and directing action, withholding action, these kinds of things.

        "source_doc": "One of the main functions of the prefrontal cortex is that when it's working well, it allows us to direct our focus and our cognition, our thinking, in a context-dependent way. One of the simplest ways to describe this is that when you took math in high school or if you're still taking math, your brain had to carry out certain types of cognitive operations that were very different than the types of cognitive operations that you need to carry out in your history class or your social studies class. There were some features of all three"

        "source_doc": "There were some features of all three of those classes that were the same, in the sense that presumably, you had to sit in a chair for all of those classes. You followed a certain set of rules that pertained to all three of those different classes, even though there are different subjects. But then, there were certain rules that pertained just to mathematics, certain rules that you followed because a particular teacher was strict-- not because of the topic they were covering-- as well as certain rules that maybe you did not pay attention to because a different teacher was a little more lax. For instance, maybe there was a teacher that let you put your feet up on the chair in front of you. Maybe, another teacher forbid that at all costs. The point being that your prefrontal cortex is the area of your brain that, along with other areas of your brain, ensures that you engage in context-specific behavior, context-specific thinking and context-specific understanding about what you should and should not do.

It's a lot more extensive than that. In fact, we will probably do an entire episode all about both cognitive flexibility and perhaps, even a separate episode on task switching. Task switching is somewhat distinct from cognitive flexibility. First of all task, switching requires cognitive flexibility, but they are not the same thing. Now, when we talk about task switching-- or rather, when you see task switching in the scientific literature-- most often, it has to do with people performing one particular type of mental or physical operation. Say, they're maneuvering things with their hands or other parts of their body, or they are required to carry out one specific type of mental process. And then, they are required, either at random intervals or at specific intervals-- maybe every 10 minutes or so-- to switch their attention and to do a different task entirely.

        "source_doc": "In the laboratory experiment situation, this has most typically been carried out the following way. People are going to do one cognitive task, maybe mathematics, or they're going to count, for instance, from 1 up to infinity, as high as they can go in a given amount of time, in increments of say, 7 or increments of 7 plus 1 then 7 minus 1. These can be made increasingly difficult. You get the idea. And then perhaps, a tone is played or they'll get a signal from the experimenter. They need to switch their task to doing something quite different, but also cognitive. That's the most typical arrangement. Another typical arrangement in a task switching experiment is that the person in the task switching experiment will be asked to do some sort of physical manipulation of objects, maybe placement of puzzle pieces into the correct configuration. Then at some designated interval or intervals, they will have to switch to a different manual task. Fewer-- not zero, but fewer-- experiments have examined task switching between physical and cognitive tasks. There are these kind of outrageous examples that you can find on the internet. By the way, I don't suggest that anyone go engage in these examples in real life of extreme task switching. One of the most notable ones would be chess boxing. Believe it or not, this exists, where two people will enter a ring. They will sit down at a table. They will play chess for a given period of time. They're entirely focused on playing chess. Then a buzzer will go off. The chess table will be cleared. The chairs will be cleared. They will be expected to box, literally fight, for a round of a minute to three minutes, and then, go back to chess, then to boxing, so-called chess boxing. Again, I'm not suggesting people chess box. But I know that many people have challenges with task switching. Here, I can raise my"

I have a much greater challenge in switching out of that focused mode to doing the next thing, which is one of the reasons why oftentimes, I run tardy, because I'm still mentally thinking about or physically engaged in the thing that I was doing before. This is something I'm constantly working on. As a consequence, I've had to seek out and implement certain tools to improve my ability to task switch. I'm going to share a few of those tools with you now, because I know a number of people probably struggle with the same thing. As I mentioned earlier, I'm also going to do a full-length episode about task switching, both the underlying mechanisms of task switching as well as a more extensive list of tools related to task switching, as a full-length Huberman Lab podcast episode. How can we get better at task switching? Short of having somebody scruff you by the neck and force you to stop whatever activity you're doing and engage in the next activity that you're doing, one of the best things that we can do to support our ability to task switch-- that's nicely supported both at the mechanistic level and at the practical level within the published literature-- is to introduce short transition gaps between the activities that we're trying to switch between.

In fact, when was the last time you heard about the requirement for introducing gaps between tasks if you want to switch between them more efficiently? And yet, as a consequence of this not being discussed very often, I think a lot of people have placed an undue burden on themselves. For instance, a lot of people think that when you sit down with a book and you're going to read, that you should be able to immediately focus on the material that you're reading and not have your mind flitting about. During the first five, maybe even 10 minutes of reading a book chapter, unless you are absolutely enthralled from the first word, or you are intensely curious what the material in that book chapter is-- maybe that book chapter is about you and what's going to happen to you next in your life. Maybe the news article is about something that you care oh so much about. But unless it's one of those specific instances, it's going to be about five or 10 minutes before the neural circuits in your brain that are required to understand and digest and commit that material to memory are going to come online at the levels of activity that are going to be required for you to experience that as intense focus, or even as mild focus. The activity of the brain is always going to be in a push-pull. This is extremely important for understanding task switching. When you go from one task-- and maybe the task was simply to walk over to where the book is located-- to focusing on the material within that book, you have to both engage activity within certain neural circuits and you need to disengage the activity of other neural circuits. Sometimes, this is referred to as inhibition of certain neural circuits. Other times, it's just going to be a dissipation of activity of those neural circuits. They're just going to quiet down, like a dimming of"

They're just going to quiet down, like a dimming of the lights in a particular room, while the activity of other neural circuits increases. The first thing that you really need to understand, if you want to get better at task switching, is that you cannot and you should not expect yourself to immediately drop into a narrow trench of focus, or a narrow trench of ability, for anything that you're not already extremely skilled at or extremely interested in knowing. One of the reasons why this is often overlooked is that, for instance, if we receive a text message from somebody and we are very interested in what's contained in that text message, maybe even eagerly anticipating the dot, dot, dot in that little window where the text message is going to arrive-- like here it comes. Here it comes. Here it comes. It's an example of where you are able to immediately pay attention and absorb information. For instance, if you're trying to meet somebody in a big city, and you need to know exactly where to meet them, and you've arrived at the place where you thought you need to be and then, you can't find them. You're waiting. Where are you? Where are you? You're going to commit that information to memory and you're going to act on it. But when you sit down to read a book of unknown content, or where you have just a general sense of what the content is, or when you sit down to do something like work on a spreadsheet or your taxes, or engage in a conversation with somebody, expect a five to 10 minute transition period.

Perhaps indeed, they have clinically diagnosable attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or some other form of attention deficit disorder. I certainly can't rule that out based on this conversation alone. But a lot of people place this unfair burden on themselves to immediately be able to focus on a given task. This is also true for physical tasks. If you go to the gym to work out or you're heading out on a run or a cycling expedition, the idea that you would immediately be able to cycle at your peak performance, or that you could perform sets and reps in the gym as best as you possibly could without any warm-up, without any transition period, that you could forget about the difficult or maybe even great conversation that you were having on the way in, or that you could forget about other activities that you need to do in the rest of your day, that's just completely unfair. It doesn't match at all the way that your neural circuits work. You really need to match your expectation of your ability to focus on and perform a given task, whether or not it's cognitive or physical, to the actual underlying biology. That's the first point.

        "source_doc": "The second point is that we know that if you want to switch from one task to another task, that you are making it more difficult to drop into full-task engagement-- or rather, engagement with task B following task A, if you try and go immediately from task A to task B-- that even the introduction-- I find this so cool-- even the introduction of an arbitrary but very short transition period of say, 15 seconds, where you know that you're introducing 15 seconds of transition and you designate it as transition, will allow you to engage in a more efficient and more complete level of task execution on task B if you introduce even a brief transition period. This I find fascinating, because what this means is that there are top down influences. There are literally things that we can tell ourselves, based on an understanding of the underlying mechanisms, that allow us to task switch better. This certainly doesn't involve taking any kind of prescription drug or supplement or doing anything differently, except as you go from task A to task B, knowing and designating that a transition period, even a very brief one where you are not trying to perform task B and that you've designated this as a transition period. I'm not trying to focus on the next thing that I need to do. I might focus on it inadvertently, but I'm not deliberately trying to focus on it. Rather, I'm going to think about what I just did and the fact that I'm no longer doing that, kind of leaving it like a fog behind. You're trying to move from this deep trench of attention, hopefully on task A-- or maybe, you didn't achieve a deep trench of attention-- and you're now done with task A. You're not placing this unfair expectation on your neural circuits to just flip to task B. You're also acknowledging that task B is going to take five to 10 minutes to drop into fully. We already talked about"

        "source_doc": "What comes in that transition period and its duration is important. First, let's deal with the duration. How long should the transition period be? That is going to scale directly with how long you are in a deep trench of focus for task A. Let's assume task A was something that was kind of light for you. Maybe, you're just handling some email. Maybe, you're talking to a coworker. Maybe, you were at a board meeting and it was kind of light. The stuff was just OK. You're used to this stuff. This is stuff that you do all the time. Now, you're headed back to your desk or you're headed to your next class. Or perhaps, you did a workout that morning and now, you're going to head to your place of work. Or maybe, you're leaving work and you're going to engage with family. You know need to switch all these cognitive operations. You need to dump the stuff that you were just doing cognitively, and you now need to do a bunch of other things. Context is switching. Task is switching. Just ask yourself, how deeply was I entrenched in that other activity? Was my mind flitting to other things? If I was in a deep trench of attention for that given thing, then you should give yourself slightly longer for this transition period, maybe five or even 10 minutes if you have that time. Even if you give yourself as short as 60 to 90 seconds of transition and you just designate it as transition, you're going to benefit in terms of your ability to do the next task. To be very clear, if you were in kind of a light task or something that didn't have much cognitive demand, then the transition period can be fairly short. It can be just a couple of minutes. Rather, if you were in a deep trench of attention, you really engaged in that first"

        "source_doc": "minutes. Rather, if you were in a deep trench of attention, you really engaged in that first task, I suggest giving yourself a couple of minutes or more, maybe as much as five to 10 minutes. But you might not have that much time. In which case, give yourself any kind of transition, even if it's 10 seconds. I certainly have had times in my life, in particular when I was a new assistant professor before I got tenure, where I remember sitting down to work on a grant. I'd get two lines out. Someone would knock on the door. Hey, where are the whatever, the 30 mil syringes? Where do we keep the buffers? Did we get this thing in? And then, I'd have to shift my attention and go back to writing. I'd be distracted by something else again. Which is not to say that people were distracting me unfairly. It was simply the case that, at that time, my life required being involved in a lot more things than it did as my career progressed, at least in the short term. The point being that if you are deeply engaged in an activity, give yourself a little bit longer in the transition period between them. If you are sort of superficially involved in an activity, you need less of a transition period. But you need a transition period. What should come during that transition period?"

This is what's so destructive about the phone. Keep in mind, I am not one of these people that thinks that smartphones are terrible. In fact, I use mine plural, very often, all day, often. Not necessarily during deep cognitive focus, but in between those bouts of focus, I have to text message people. I do work on there. I'm on social media, so certainly not demonizing the smartphone. However, if you finish a given activity-- whether or not it's cognitive or physical activity-- and you are headed to something else that requires you do a new task, and that task requires significant amounts of attention and focus, then you would do very well to allow yourself a period of anywhere from two minutes to maybe, as long as 10 minutes-- I know this is going to be very hard for people-- but two minutes to as long as 10 minutes where you are not looking at your phone. You're not texting. You're not on social media. You're not foraging for anything. In fact, you're trying to limit the total amount of information that you're bringing into your nervous system. Now, you don't have to walk around with eyes closed and try and not hear and not see. Let's be practical, folks. That's impossible to do anyway. You can't shut down your brain while awake. You can go into states of deeper relaxation. There's a non-sleep deep rest, which we'll talk about in a little bit. But you can't shut off your brain deliberately, not in any healthy way that is. But by introducing these transition zones, or transition periods as we'll call them, of two to 10 minutes between different tasks, and making sure that within those transition periods, you are not bringing in new information--"

It's so easy. It's so reflexive. But it is. It's bringing in a lot of new context, in particular pictures and movies which are tremendous stimulus for the nervous system and anchoring your attention. It's bringing in new ideas, new thoughts that no matter how hard you try, are going to intrude into your ability to perform task B. When people say, how do I get better at task switching, I immediately want to say, please don't introduce yet more tasks. Switching from one task to another is hard enough already. Don't introduce another task in between. Some of you might take this to mean that you shouldn't have a conversation with a coworker after a meeting while walking down the hall. I'm not saying that.

However, I will say, after many years of working in laboratories that at times were quite large, if you walk into the lab and there are a lot of different things going on, one of the things that you learn how to do, if you're going to get good at your craft, is to not pay attention to what's going on with everyone crowded around a computer looking at who's winning at the World Cup. I'm not trying to insult soccer players here. I enjoy soccer, both playing it and observing it. But one has to scruff themselves a little bit in trying to limit their attention to a number of different things in the environment, and really go from task A to task B in a really dedicated way. Short lists benefit certain people. I know a lot of people are list makers out there. They like to put two or three things, or maybe 20 things that they're going to accomplish each day. One of the best tools that I ever learned, both for the sake of task switching but also for sake of just getting things done on a consistent basis-- I picked up while I was a master's student at Berkeley-- a very accomplished professor at that time told me that he writes down every day three things that he's going to accomplish and only three things, never more than three. He also included other activities. In fact, he was quite active in his physical life. He rode his bike to campus. He also was a runner. He also went to the gym. He did not include those on his list of three things. He would write down no more than three critical things to do each day. He had three critical tasks. I've employed that method as well. I'll write down one, sometimes two, most often three, but if I can, just one or two tasks that I need to complete"

But I limit the things that require a lot of cognitive focus to three things per day. However, those three things per day can take up many, many hours each and certainly, on the whole. There are additional things that one can do to improve your ability to task switch. One of the things that I found particularly beneficial is not a meditation, but rather, is a perceptual exercise. This is a perceptual exercise that I learned about when I was a graduate student, but in a totally different context. It has to do with the way that your visual system and the parts of your brain that parse time are related to one another and influence one another. The reason this tool makes sense for improving your ability to task switch is because it turns out that where you focus your visual attention strongly influences the way that your brain parses time. I'll describe the tool first. And then, I'll get a little bit into the underlying mechanisms. Again, I'll get deep into the underlying mechanisms, as well as the tool, as well as additional tools, in a future episode about task switching on the Huberman Lab podcast. If you were to, for instance, close your eyes and not look at anything in your external environment and just concentrate, for instance, on your breathing or the feeling on the surface of your skin-- I know this is starting to sound like meditation, but trust me, it's not meditation-- your perception of time, that is, how finely you are slicing time, would be distinctly different than if you were to open your eyes and focus on a faraway location, say way off in the horizon, and"

The perceptual tool for task switching is a very simple one. It's one that frankly, I do every morning and have for many years now and at least, for me, has really enhanced my ability to task switch.

I should mention, I typically do this in an environment where ideally, I can see off into the distance, perhaps from a balcony if I'm in an apartment or a house, ideally outdoors. But if I'm indoors, I'll still do this. I'll just look as far off into the distance as I can when that step is required. I start off by closing my eyes and essentially not looking at anything, but directing my brain's focus to either the surface of my body, just what it feels like, what it's in contact with or not in contact with, maybe my breathing. Then, I'll open my eyes and I will focus on some location on my body but my bodily surface, like my hand at some distance. I'll focus my attention there maybe for just five to 15 seconds. I should mention that the first station, as I call them, where my eyes were closed and I was focusing on my bodily sensations, I also just do that for about five to 15 seconds. I don't count specifically, just roughly five to 15 seconds. Second station, you're looking at the surface of your hand. If you like, you can also concentrate on your breathing. But typically, people will just focus on some specific location on their hand. Then, I'll typically lower my hand. Then, I'll look off into the distance, maybe five to 10 feet. It doesn't really matter. Focus my visual attention there. Try and hold that focus for five to 15 seconds. Then, I'll look further off in the distance, maybe, further still off into the distance.

Again, starting with eyes closed, focusing on self five to 15 seconds. Then, eyes open, focusing on surface of one's body, that is, focusing one's visual attention five to 15 seconds maybe 10 feet away, then maybe, 50 feet away. If you're in the metric system, meters works just as well. These distances do not have to be precise. And then, off to the horizon and then, back to one's immediate location by closing one's eyes.

        "source_doc": "What is happening when one does this perceptual exercise? Again, it's a perceptual exercise. It's a visual perceptual exercise. What's happening is, you are shifting your visual focus, obviously. But you're also shifting the way in which you fine slice or thick slice time. Your ability to recognize, consciously, whether or not your thin slicing or thick slicing time is much harder to get a grasp of than it is to get a grasp of whether or not you're looking at your hand or off in the distance. That's kind of obvious. But what we know for sure is that as you shift your attention from your immediate environment out to different designated locations in your environment, and your time perception shifts accordingly, you're essentially training your brain to shift visual focus and the way in which you process in the time domain. This is important in the context of task switching, because so much of task switching is not just to understand OK, I'm going from reading to running or from running to reading and the different types of operations that are required in one case versus the other, but also, a shift in the neural circuits that underlie your perception of time. Again, this is a topic that deserves a much more elaborate discussion. So much of our ability to execute a task with high proficiency has to do with getting our thinking and our actions into the correct time domain. When I say time domain, I know a number of people can get confused because time is time. People think, what do you mean by time domain? Space domain makes sense. Here, I'm not talking about outer space, whether or not you're looking in one location or another close to your body or far away from your body are different domains of space. But the time domain is a little trickier for most people to understand. Just think of it this way. When you see a slow motion movie, what you're seeing is a movie that was shot"

        "source_doc": "way. When you see a slow motion movie, what you're seeing is a movie that was shot at a high frame rate, many frames per second. The typical smartphone shoots movies at about 60 frames per second, some older ones, 30 frames per second. The slow-mo function on your smartphone is actually a high frame rate function. You took the same movie, but you took it at a higher frame rate. You've got a lot more images. Therefore, you can generate slow motion. With your visual system, when you focus very close in to your body or you're focused on bodily sensations in your immediate environment, you are fine slicing in the time domain more so than when you are looking further off in the distance. Similarly, when you engage in one type of task, like a board meeting or a Zoom meeting or a conversation with friends, you are in a very different set of neural circuit functions than when you sit down to read or learn math or lift weights or go to therapy or go for a walk with your dog, for instance.

I'm moving from this thing to that thing. I just need like 10 seconds. I'm going to recognize. I'm going to count down 10 to one or one up to 10. It doesn't matter. This is transition time. But this is not a time to look at my phone or to be in lots of different time domains. You might say, well, does that mean I shouldn't look at the horizon while I'm walking from my meeting back to my desk? No. That's not the way that your brain works. It doesn't anchor to things that just happen to be in your environment unless they're of particular interest. What I'm saying is, set a transition period between tasks ideally, two maybe as long as 10 minutes. I'm also saying that when you switch between tasks, or when you initiate your first major task of the day, please expect-- do expect-- a period in which it's hard to get into the groove, so to speak. In addition to that, I recommend having some of practice. I described the practice that I've used for some period of time now, at least for me to great success, where you are deliberately shifting your visual attention between different locations close to you and far away. You're doing that as a perceptual practice. Again, the whole thing only takes about two minutes, maybe three minutes. You don't even need to do it every day. I happen to do it every day, but I miss the occasional day here and there. Even if you were to do this perceptual practice once a week or three times a week, I'm certain that you'll benefit.

You start to see and feel, literally see and feel, the way that transition occurs. It takes a little bit of time. But you can accelerate that transition if you understand that oh, when I'm looking here and engaging in this type of behavior or sets of tasks and then, I'm now going to be expected to do another task in a completely different type of environment, the brain is going to be required to shift over the neural circuits that are active and less active in order to do that. You can accelerate that process by practicing it using that perceptual tool that I described. There, I covered some specific tools that one can use to enhance one's ability to task switch, touching on a bit of the underlying neurobiology and why transition periods are useful, if not required. If you think about there's always a transition period when task switching, but here, you're taking conscious control over that transition period. There are additional tools for enhancing one's ability to task switch. They tend to be somewhat specific for the certain kinds of cognitive or physical tasks that one needs to do. The example of chess boxing that I gave earlier, a great example of task switching at its extreme, terrible example of a practice space-time bridging. Very safe, I can't think of any way in which it might be dangerous, although please don't do it while driving or while operating any other machinery. By all accounts, very safe, zero cost.

First of all, it's to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which of course, will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length. We are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast, and to fund research, in particular, research done on human beings. Not animal models, but on human beings, which I think we all agree, is a species that we are most interested in. We are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance. Those protocols will be distributed through all channels, not just the premium channel, but through all channels, Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. The idea here is to give you information to your burning questions, in depth, and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the Tiny Foundation has generously offered to do a dollar-for-dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel. This is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel, to further support research for science and science-related tools for mental health, physical health, and performance.

        "source_doc": "The first question is about resveratrol. The question specifically is, and I quote, \"there seems to be a lot of conjecture about resveratrol and whether or not it can extend lifespan. Could you please tell us your thoughts on this subject?\" OK, well, I will indeed tell you my thoughts on this subject. And I'll use it as an opportunity to also give you my thoughts about supplementation for sake of longevity, that is, for extending lifespan, more generally. So resveratrol got a lot of attention some years back because, at the time, it was believed that supplementing with resveratrol could impact certain cellular pathways that would extend not just the lifespan of those individual cells but perhaps the lifespan of the entire organism, meaning us, humans. And as a consequence, supplements such as resveratrol supplements but also grape seed extracts, which we know contain a fair amount of resveratrol or can be converted into resveratrol, also received a lot of attention for their potential to increase lifespan. I think by now, 2023, it's fair to say that most of that thinking has been, let's just say, debunked. I think that most people understand that while indeed resveratrol might have some positive effects on the functioning of our cells that there is very little, if any, direct evidence that resveratrol can increase lifespan. If you are aware of any data to the contrary that is modern, is highly controlled, and even better, was carried out in human studies or non-human primate studies or even mouse studies, please put links to those in the comments on YouTube, because I'd love to see those studies, especially recent studies. But my current line of thinking is that"

        "source_doc": "Now, with that said, that doesn't mean that things like resveratrol or grape seed extract are of zero utility. In fact, I take 400 to 800 milligrams of grape seed extract, usually with a meal. It's just part of my standard supplementation stack every single day. But I do that mainly for its effects on vascular function and blood flow and a few other effects that grape seed extract has been related to. The data there, I would say, are reasonably strong, strong enough certainly that when weighed against the potential downsides of taking grape seed extract, including the cost of grape seed extract, lead me to take 400 to 800 milligrams grape seed extract per day. I just do that as a kind of general insurance policy against a number of things. And it's part of a small kit of supplements that I take that fall into that category, meaning supplements that appear to be very safe, certainly at the dosages that I just referred to, supplements that potentially are having positive effects on our cells, and that are fairly if not very low cost. So that's why I take grape seed extract. I do not take it for its potential impact on resveratrol and resveratrol-related pathways per se and certainly not to extend my lifespan. So that basically answers the question that I was asked,"

And I'm thinking about taking grape seed extract. Would that be one of the top 10 supplements you would recommend? I certainly wouldn't put it in the top 10. And by the way, at some point in the not too distant future, I will put online-- so I'll probably do a podcast episode-- listing out all the supplements that I take and the rationale behind those and how long I've taken them and the effects that I've observed both subjectively and in my blood work and what I recommend to other people, what I don't recommend to other people, what's specific to me, and so on and so forth.

        "source_doc": "Now, with that said, let's use this as an opportunity to talk about some of the other so-called longevity supplements and drugs that are often discussed online and elsewhere in terms of their efficacy to increase lifespan. About four or five years ago, there was a sudden and increased attention on NAD-related pathways for increasing longevity. So the NAD pathway, as some of you may already know, is a pathway within all of our cells. This is a pathway that is highly active in young animals and humans. But all animals and humans across the entire lifespan make NAD in their cells. It's related to cellular energetics. That is the production of energy in cells. It has direct relevance to mitochondrial function and mitochondrial function to it. And that's a discussion unto itself. But suffice it to say that the pathway leading to NAD includes things such as NR and NMN. NR and NMN are considered by many to be precursors to NAD. OK, so why am I telling you all these acronyms? Here's the deal. The argument was made, in fact, by some prior guests on the Huberman Lab podcast and elsewhere that by increasing NAD levels in our cells that one could potentially extend lifespan. And there are generally three ways in which people have attempted to do that. OK, we'll talk about whether or not increasing NAD in our cells actually increases lifespan in a moment. But for the time being, let's just talk about some of the ways that people have tried to increase NAD within their brain and body. The most typical ways that people have done that is through, until very recently, supplementation. And so there are supplements out there such as NR which we know can increase NAD levels. So this is taken as a pill or a"

But there again, the idea was by taking NAD either in capsule form, or it's sometimes taken as a sublingual powder, that one could increase NAD levels and thereby potentially increase lifespan. And then there's a third way that's commonly used to try and increase NAD levels, and that's by infusing by intravenous infusion, or in some cases, by oral administration, either liquid or pill form, NAD itself. Now, I confess that I have tried all three of these approaches. OK, so I do indeed take an NR supplement every day."

So I'll take anywhere from 1 to 2 grams of NMN as a sublingual powder, which as the name suggests, you put it under your tongue, and it dissolves there. It's got this kind of tangy flavor. And the goal for me in taking an NR and NMN each day-- and I should mention that sometimes I have just taken NMN or just NR to do the comparison between NR and NMN for me in a subjective way, just comparing what are my energy levels, how do I feel, whether or not there are any side effects. And then I've also taken them together. And I've arrived at a protocol where I take NR and NMN every single day. And the goal of that is indeed to increase NAD levels within my system. However, and I really want to emphasize this, I do not take NR and NMN in order to increase my lifespan. In fact, at this point in history, it's unclear and seems somewhat unlikely that increasing NAD is going to increase lifespan. But I think we should always keep our minds open. There may be data to arrive in the future that shows that actually does happen in humans. Now, there are some animal data suggesting that increasing NAD either by taking NR and/or NMN can increase lifespan. But frankly, that is not why I take NR and NMN. I take NR and NMN in an effort to increase NAD. And now I realize what I'm about to say is entirely subjective. And I really want to highlight that. What I'm about to"

When I take NR and NMN at the dosages I talked about a little bit earlier, it gives me a lot of sustained mental and physical energy throughout the day. Now, I've always had a lot of mental and physical energy. But I'm 48 years old now. And I'm interested in doing anything that I safely can to keep those levels of energy as high as is reasonable, right? I don't want to have so much energy that I can't sit still or so much energy that I can't sleep at night. But I find that when I take NR and NMN in the morning-- so typically, I'll do this before my first meal. I don't really regulate how close it is to that first meal. So I'll wake up, use the bathroom, hydrate, get my sunlight, do all the things I've talked about on other podcasts. But I'll take my NR and NMN sometime usually within about an hour or two of waking up and typically at least 30 minutes to two hours before my first meal, which for me usually arrives around 11:00 a.m. So sometimes I'll take it long before my first meal. In any event, it gives me a lot of energy. And I seem to have that energy throughout the day. I have gone periods of time where I stopped taking NR and/or NMN. And while I didn't feel as if I was completely depleted of energy, I did notice a decrement in energy compared to when I took NR and NMN. Now, I want to be very, very clear. I have no, zero,"

        "source_doc": "So earlier this year-- that is in 2023-- there was a filing for NMN as a experimental drug in a clinical trial. And as a consequence, NMN was listed as a banned or not allowed to be commercially sold supplement. And that has to do with some of the legality around clinical trials. And when something is listed as an experimental drug, it can't be listed as a supplement. Nonetheless, you can still find NMN on the open market. You can find it on Amazon. I can't really speak to the purity of one source versus another. You'll have to explore that on your own. But I will say this, even though I said it before. I have zero financial relationship to any company that manufactures and sells NMN at this time or NR at this time. So the short summary to this whole discussion about NR and NMN is that I take NR and NMN, but I take it because I like how it makes me feel. It increases my energy levels in the morning and throughout the day. And it does so in a way that tapers off nicely in the evening, and I can still fall asleep, et cetera. I do not take it with any expectation that it's going to increase my lifespan, simply because I don't think the data substantiating the extension and lifespan are here yet. They may arrive at some point. But I don't think that they are here yet. So there are a good number of people out there that still take NR and/or NMN and are doing so in efforts to increase NAD. And so let's take a moment and talk about increasing NAD directly, because that's something that I have some recent experience with, and that's becoming more common and is, yes, still FDA approved, at least as far"

There are companies that can come to your house, or you can go to a facility, and they will give you an NAD infusion. So they will infuse you directly with NAD into the vein. I've done this twice now. And I will say, as most people experience when they do an NAD infusion, it's pretty darn uncomfortable. In fact, so much so that a lot of people have to take anti-nausea meds in order to get the NAD infusion. I opted to not take the anti-nausea meds, not because I'm particularly tough, but because I don't like taking additional medication if I can. But I've taken anywhere from 500 to 1,000 milligrams of NAD by infusion. I did that at times when I was feeling particularly rundown or post-illness. And I did indeed find that after the NAD infusion was complete, I felt much, much better in a number of different ways-- improved sleep, improved vigor, coming off those illnesses. I felt much better. But again, there is no clinical trial exploring NAD infusion for sake of vigor, et cetera, that I am aware of. I just happen to be somebody who is interested in exploring these tools and techniques from time to time. And I deemed this as safe. Whether or not it's safe for you, you have to explore with your physician. Also, I do want to reemphasize what I said a moment ago. Those NAD infusions are pretty darn uncomfortable. You can have the person administering the infusion adjust the rate of the infusion so that the drip is slower, which makes it more tolerable as opposed to trying"

I have heard of some people doing NAD infusions later in the day and having challenges with sleep. But again, that's just anecdotal. Or we could call it anecdata, if you want, but it's anecdotal. It's generally assumed for obvious reasons that NAD infusions are more effective at increasing cellular levels of NAD than NR or NMN or both together, although the direct comparison has not been made, as far as I know. And there's still this general question as to whether or not any of this stuff is getting into cells directly and impacting NAD levels in specific cells, although I think most people assume that the NAD infusions certainly are. Now, there are a number of different experts out there who debate all the fine points of everything that I just said, people like Dr. Charles Brenner and people like Dr. David Sinclair, people like Matt Kaeberlein. There are people who really actively, and let's just say, heatedly debate all the issues that I just talked about. I think the greatest debate is around whether or not increasing NAD levels in cells actually increases lifespan. But there's also a debate around whether or not NR is more advantageous than NMN, whether or not all of this is too premature to explore yet already. Again, I just want to restate for the third time. I don't do any of this stuff in these NAD pathways for sake of increasing lifespan. I do it for sake of the vitality and energy effects that I subjectively experience. I must say that the NAD infusions are expensive enough, inconvenient"

I would be very curious to learn from any of you, the audience, what sorts of things you've experienced if perhaps you've explored NR supplementation, NMN supplementation, or NAD infusions. And as I mentioned earlier, there's now a growing number of different products that claim that you can take NAD orally, so either in pill, tincture or other forms, so no requirement for an infusion. But I'm not aware of any studies that have directly linked oral NAD to NAD levels in cells and how those two things relate. So lots more important science to be done in this area, lots more debate surely to be had, and any time we talk about supplements, I just want to emphasize several times that I do see supplements as indeed supplements.

It is indeed something that, provided it fits within your safety and economic frameworks, could potentially enhance mental health, physical health, performance in certain ways. But it's certainly not the foundation from which you build mental health, physical health, and performance. So now we've talked about resveratrol, a little bit about grape seed extract. We've talked about NR and NMN and NAD and the NAD pathway. There are a few other things that are commonly discussed in the longevity sphere, let's call it, things such as metformin. I'll just be very direct and say I do not take metformin. And I also don't take what some people call the poor man's version of metformin, which is berberine. Berberine gives me brutal headaches. Berberine lowers blood glucose. That's why I think it's giving me brutal headaches. A lot of people have explored or are thinking about exploring taking metformin or berberine for sake of lowering blood glucose and lowering a particular cellular, let's just say, pathway or a set of molecules, mTOR being the most common of them. mTOR, mammalian Target of Rapamycin, is abundant in developing cells. It's responsible for the growth of individual cells.

So the logic that people have waged is that drugs like metformin or compounds like berberine that reduce mTOR levels or impact the mTOR pathway in ways that lead to net decreases in mTOR, the logic is that could somehow increase lifespan. There's also the logic that fasting can reduce mTOR which can increase lifespan. I don't think there's any direct evidence for that yet, however, at least not in humans. So I'll tell you. I don't take berberine for the reasons I mentioned before. It makes me feel uncomfortable. Not psychologically uncomfortable, it makes me feel physically uncomfortable. I don't take metformin because expert colleagues of mine, including Dr. Peter Attia, have come on this podcast. In fact, we did a collaboration journal club podcast that we'll provide a link to in the show note captions during which we, meaning mainly Peter, reviewed the peer-reviewed data on metformin and lifespan. And at least to my understanding, at present, there isn't sufficient data to support taking metformin for increasing lifespan. So that's why I don't take it.

Remember mTOR, mammalian Target of Rapamycin, is so named because it's a target of this drug, which is used largely as an anticancer drug but has other purposes as well. Rapamycin is actively under investigation, which makes it sound like there was a crime committed. But as far as I know, there wasn't. Under active scientific exploration would be the more accurate way to say it, by excellent researchers such as Dr. Matt Kaeberlein up at the University of Washington in Seattle. He's been looking at rapamycin for its ability to extend lifespan, focusing on many different species, including dogs. So he has a dog longevity project. So that's really interesting. Dr. Peter Attia has talked a lot about rapamycin and did a recent podcast about rapamycin with not only Matt Kaeberlein but one of the experts in the world on mTOR. So I invite you to check out that podcast if you want to learn about rapamycin. So there is a fair amount of understanding about the biological pathways of rapamycin and mTOR and so on. And there are clinician physicians, like Peter as well as others, who are quite excited about the potential for rapamycin to extend lifespan, although you have to go directly to Peter to find out exactly what he's doing, whether or not he's taking rapamycin or not.

It is a drug that I think can be taken safely under certain conditions but has enough of a side effect profile that I'm not interested in taking it for sake of increasing lifespan at this time. So no metformin, no rapamycin for me right now, perhaps in the future. I've listed out the things that I'm perfectly willing and happy to do, grape seed extract, NR and NMN, the occasional NAD infusion to increase NAD directly, and for the time being, I've decided to stay away from metformin and rapamycin. But of course, any and all of that could change going forward depending on the data that are published and my own experiences. As a final point on this, I want to again emphasize that the foundation of a quality life and a long life is most certainly going to come from the basics, perhaps the most fundamental and important of which is to get sufficient amounts of quality sleep each night. We know that not doing that can indeed reduce your lifespan if not directly, then certainly indirectly by increased number of accidents and certainly being far less happy and energetic during the day. So that's fundamental."

So forgive me, Peter. This won't be nearly as eloquent or succinct as Peter would make it. But it is very, very clear that at present there is no supplement or drug for increasing longevity that even comes close to the known improvements in health metrics that relate to longevity that come from getting quality sleep and especially from getting sufficient amounts of quality exercise. So that means both a combination of cardiovascular exercise, a minimum of 180 to 220 minutes of so-called zone 2 cardio per week. So that's cardio that you can carry out while still maintaining a conversation but should you increase the intensity any more, you would have a hard time completing your sentences. But in addition to that also doing some VO2 max work, so getting your heart rate way, way up at least once per week, and also, of course, doing resistance training either with weights, machines or bodyweight, doing that at sufficient intensity, six sets minimum per body part per week to maintain not just muscular size and strength but equally important, perhaps even more important, maintaining nerve to muscle connectivity, which correlates with cognitive function and a number of other important longevity metrics. So again exercise, sleep, quality nutrition, quality social connection, which means eliminating as best you can toxic social connection and increasing quality social connection, people that you like and enjoy spending time with and feel enriched by, stress modulation, all of these things are so key.

        "source_doc": "compared to anything that you could take in pill, capsule or infusion. So before even considering taking any supplement or drug to increase your longevity or even for increasing vitality for that matter, get those basics of sleep, sunlight, nutrition, movement, stress modulation, or stress control, I should say, and relationships down. Get those right. And get that morning sunlight to set your circadian rhythm, because of course, your circadian rhythm is what anchors it all. And I'd be completely remiss if I didn't emphasize yet again that any time you're thinking of adding a supplement or removing a supplement from your regimen or adding a prescription drug or removing a prescription drug, you absolutely should consult you're board-certified physician.

        "source_doc": "The first question is about how to improve sleep. In particular, how to improve deep sleep that is sometimes called slow-wave sleep. This was a question that was asked by Jack Pritchard and they got a lot of up votes. Now, we've done multiple full-length episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast on sleep and tools to improve sleep, including the Master Your Sleep episode and Perfect Your Sleep episode, as well as a toolkit that is available completely zero cost at hubermanlab.com. It's a downloadable PDF that lists out the behavioral tools and other tools that you can implement to improve your sleep. Now Jack's question is specifically about how to improve deep sleep. He asks, I have a sleep analyzer and I typically observe that I get a lot of REM sleep, that is rapid eye movement sleep. For him, he says it's 30% of his total sleep is rapid eye movement sleep. But he asks, my deep sleep is often low, around 10%, and I would like to know if there are any science-backed protocols I can use to specifically increase my deep sleep. Okay, so for those of you that may not know what is deep sleep. Now, deep sleep is sometimes referred to as slow-wave sleep, that is slow-wave sleep and deep sleep are sometimes used interchangeably to describe the same thing. They aren't necessarily the same thing,"

        "source_doc": "They aren't necessarily the same thing, but they fall under the same mechanistic umbrella. What is that mechanistic umbrella? Well, when you go to sleep at night, you cycle through a number of different stages of sleep. And in the early part of the night, I would say in the first half of your night or so, most of your sleep is going to be slow-wave deep sleep. But then as you transition into the second half of your night, more of your sleep will be rapid eye movement sleep. Now that's the typical pattern that is observed when you're not disrupting your sleep architecture with things like caffeine and alcohol. We'll talk about caffeine and alcohol in a few minutes. Deep sleep, aka slow-wave sleep,"

        "source_doc": "Deep sleep, aka slow-wave sleep, at least for sake of this conversation, is vitally important in particular for repair of bodily tissues. During deep sleep, you secrete growth hormone and in fact you secrete growth hormone every night when you go to sleep. But most of that growth hormone release is restricted to the first half of your sleep night. The other feature of deep sleep is that the dreams that occur during deep sleep tend to be of a less emotional nature than the sorts of dreams that one experiences in rapid eye movement sleep. So just to give a broad top contour of what deep sleep, aka slow-wave sleep is really about, it tends to occur in the first half of the night, it also occurs in the second half of the night, but in the first half of the night, most of your sleep is going to be occupied by deep sleep, aka slow-wave sleep. It is the time when your bodily tissues are repaired"

        "source_doc": "It is the time when your bodily tissues are repaired in part by release of growth hormone, which is involved in metabolism, but also protein synthesis, muscle repair, repair of all cell types and tissues. And during deep sleep, your dreams tend to be somewhat mundane, sometimes a little bizarre, but typically not very emotionally loaded. That can change if you're dealing with a lot of emotionally laden circumstances in your waking life, but in general, the sleep and dreams that occur in the first part of the night is deep and it's not terribly emotionally ridden. Your body also goes through specific patterns of metabolism. Now, this relates to recent findings just this last year in which researchers monitored the output of people's breath and the various metabolic factors present in the breath as well as through blood draws, So basically doing all this while people are asleep in a laboratory. And they observe that during the first half of the night while people are in deep sleep, their body is actually metabolizing energy very differently than it does in the second half of the night. I'll come back to this in a little while, but this turns out to be very important for establishing your metabolism and the way you regulate insulin and blood glucose during the daytime. So all of this is to say that getting sufficient deep sleep, slow-wave sleep, is vitally important. And Jack's asking how he can increase the amount of deep sleep that he's getting because by his sleep tracking method, he's observing far less deep sleep than rapid eye movement sleep. Now that raises the question of how much deep sleep one should be getting overall. In general, the goal should be to balance the total amount of slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep across the night. However, I would not want people to obsess over"

        "source_doc": "whether or not they are WHOOP trackers or Ouras or whether or not you're using a mattress based or mattress cover based sleep tracker like Eight Sleep or other, is using heart rate and heart rate variability and body movement to estimate or to kind of predict whether or not you're in slow-wave sleep or rapid eye movement sleep. And that's because during rapid eye movement sleep, you tend to be in what's called atonia, you tend to be paralyzed, you can't move. And during slow-wave sleep, that's not the case. But no matter what the sleep tracking method is, if it's a standard commercial sleep tracking method, WHOOP or Eight Sleep, et cetera, it is an estimate or a best guess at what stage of sleep you're in. Whereas when you go into a sleep laboratory, like the sleep laboratory at Stanford, at University of Pennsylvania or other of the great sleep laboratories that are out there, they're going to use other methods including EEG and EMG. These are just acronyms that refer to ways to record brainwaves. They actually are going to try and observe for rapid eye movements beneath the eyelids, et cetera. So sleep trackers give you a best guess as to what stage of sleep you're in. They are not perfectly accurately, at least none of the commercially available sleep trackers are perfectly accurate. So we do want to highlight that. Okay, so now let's answer Jack's question directly,"

        "source_doc": "Okay, so now let's answer Jack's question directly, which is how to increase the total amount of slow-wave sleep. Well, there are a couple ways. First of all are the don'ts and then we'll talk about the dos. Two things that you can do to really disrupt your slow-wave sleep are to drink alcohol within eight hours prior to bedtime or even at all. Some people will find that even if they have a glass of wine or a beer with lunch, that the amount of slow-wave sleep and sometimes even the rapid eye movement sleep that they get at night is reduced and that their overall sleep architecture is disrupted. This has been shown again and again. Likewise, avoiding caffeine within eight and ideally within 12 hours of bedtime would be preferable. And if you're not a caffeine drinker, obviously you don't have to worry about this at all, but avoiding caffeine intake within that 8 to 12 hours of bedtime will greatly assist in you getting more slow-wave sleep and higher quality rapid eye movement sleep. This has been shown again and again. And as well avoiding cannabis use and maybe even CBD use within 8 to 12 hours of sleep can be very beneficial if your goal is to improve the quality of your sleep. Now, I know a lot of people rely on alcohol, cannabis and CBD in order to get into sleep. However, it's been shown many times in human studies, and this was discussed in the podcast episode that we did with the great Matt Walker, who's a professor of neuroscience and psychology at University of California, Berkeley, and a world expert in sleep and sleep science. Matt and I discussed the research showing that even though alcohol helps you fall asleep, even though cannabis can help you fall asleep, and even though CBD can help people fall"

So that's disappointing news I know for a number of the people that rely on cannabis, CBD, or alcohol to fall asleep, but I would encourage you to check out the episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast that we did about alcohol and about cannabis, including some of the health benefits of cannabis in certain situations, but also some of the detrimental effects of both alcohol and cannabis in other situations in particular for improving slow-wave sleep. So that's actually three major don'ts. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and cannabis, and let's put under the umbrella of cannabis, THC and CBD in the 8 and ideally within the 12 hours prior to sleep if your goal is to improve the total amount of slow-wave sleep that you're getting and your overall sleep architecture. In addition, it's well known that avoiding food intake in the two hours prior to sleep is going to greatly assist in the amount of growth hormone output that you achieve during the early stages of the night and the depth and duration of slow-wave sleep.

        "source_doc": "Now, I want to place an asterisk on that statement by saying if you go to sleep too hungry, it can also disrupt your sleep. So you're going to have to arrange your eating schedule and your sleeping schedule such that you're not eating too close to bedtime, but you're also not going to bed so hungry that you can't fall asleep or that you don't get into deep sleep and stay asleep. I can personally attest to the fact that if I'm too hungry, I can't fall asleep. Now for me, most nights I'm going to eat dinner sometime between 6:00 PM and 8:00 PM depending on time of year, schedules, what's going on, traffic, et cetera. And I tend to go to sleep somewhere between 10:00 PM and 11:00 PM plus or minus an hour, again, depending on time of year and what else is going on in life. So I normally have that buffer of two hours or so before going to sleep. However, there are some nights where even if I eat dinner around 7:00 PM, I'm quite hungry at 9:00 PM and I want to go to sleep. In that case, eating a small amount of food, ought not to disrupt your slow-wave sleep too much, but you do want to avoid eating large meals right before going to sleep unless, unless completely fasting and not eating something late at night will prevent you from getting into any sleep at all. In other words, it's better to make sure that you're getting to sleep than it is to avoid food just so that you get increased growth hormone output and into slow-wave sleep. I hope that's clear. You know, I have had times in my life where I'm"

        "source_doc": "I hope that's clear. You know, I have had times in my life where I'm working very, very hard and I missed dinner or something comes up and I know some people can fall asleep quite easily on an empty stomach. I've been able to do that, in particular if I'm very exhausted. I also rely on a handful of supplements to fall asleep each night, although I've not dependent on them. There have been times when I haven't been able to access those supplements and I can still fall asleep. But the point is that you don't want to be so hungry that you can't fall asleep. And yet in an ideal circumstance, especially if you're trying to increase the amount of slow-wave sleep, you would avoid food in the two hours or so before going to sleep. If you can avoid food for the three or four hours prior to sleep and still fall and stay asleep easily, that's even better for sake of increasing slow-wave sleep and growth hormone output. Now, there are some additional tools"

        "qns": "What are some additional tools for improving slow-wave sleep and the transitions between sleep stages?",
        "source_doc": "Now, there are some additional tools for improving slow-wave sleep, in particular, the transitions between slow-wave sleep and the other sleep stages because even though, as I mentioned earlier, the early part of your night is occupied primarily by slow-wave sleep, all night long you're transitioning from slow-wave sleep into an intermediate stage of sleep and then into rapid eye movement sleep and then back again. It's just that in the early part of the night, more of that time is going to be occupied by slow-wave sleep. The two ways to improve slow-wave sleep that are well documented in the literature, and here we can point to some really nice papers that I'll reference in case you want to read further, is the first one is entitled, Exercise Improves the Quality of Slow-Wave Sleep by Increasing Slow-Wave Stability. Slow-wave Stability has to do with, as researchers call it, the amount of power present in the different aspects of slow-wave sleep, So this gets a little bit technical, but this is an instance in which they brought subjects into the laboratory, they measured brainwaves by EEG, they had some other measurements as well included in subjective measures of sleep, and they looked at whether or not people were doing exercise or not prior to sleep. Now, when I say prior to sleep, I mean not within six hours prior to bedtime. In fact, exercising intensely in the six hours prior to bedtime, for many people, not all, but for many people can disrupt the total amount of slow-wave sleep that they get and can also disrupt rapid eye movement sleep. So the conditions of the study were pretty straightforward. It was a randomized crossover trial. Basically, they had people either sleeping and monitoring their sleep or they had people doing an hour of exercise at 60% of their so-called"

        "source_doc": "monitoring their sleep or they had people doing an hour of exercise at 60% of their so-called VO2 max, you can look this up, for 60 minutes. 60% of their VO2 max, that was the intensity. It's breathing pretty hard, but not extremely hard. If we were going to map that to the so-called zone, zone 2 cardio being the kind of cardio you can do steady state while holding a conversation. This would be somewhere in the probably zone 3 or zone 4, although that's not exactly what 60% of VO2 Max is going to map to every time. Think about relatively challenging cardiovascular output for 60 minutes, and they had them do that at least six hours prior to bedtime, and, this is an important and, They did have the subjects in this study in all conditions abstain from caffeine and alcohol, so that's very important. And what they observed was an enhancement of slow-wave sleep. So exercise of this sort turns out to be a very potent form of improving slow-wave sleep. Now, I do not know, because the study as far as I know has not been done, whether or not doing resistance training or some other type of exercise would've led to the same effect, although I have to imagine that if it's moderately intense to intense resistance training provided it's done far enough away from going to sleep prior to six hours before sleep, that one ought to see the same effects. Although that was not a condition in this study. But it's a very nice study. They looked at everything from changes in core body temperature to caloric expenditure. They didn't see huge changes in core body temperature changes, so that couldn't explain the effect. It really appears that the major effect of improving slow-wave sleep"

So you might say, well then why would I even want to bother? However, it's well known that getting sufficient slow-wave sleep is important not just for repair, excuse me, for repair of bodily tissues, but also for repair of brain tissues and repair and wash out of debris in the brain. And that debris is known to lead to things like dementia. So getting the best quality slow-wave sleep is extremely important for body and for brain. And getting an hour of exercise that's moderately intense and making sure that you're not doing that exercise within the six hours prior to bedtime, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol, certainly within the six hours prior to bedtime, but I would say in the 8 to 12 hours prior to bedtime would be even better or not drinking alcohol at all, or I know there are people out there that don't drink caffeine at all, I'm not one of those people, but restricting that caffeine intake to the very early part of the day, that has been shown to improve the quality and the overall architecture of sleep and slow-wave sleep in particular. That's really what this study points to. There's another tool that can improve the amount and quality of slow-wave sleep that you achieve at night. This is actually a tool that I've started using over the last six to eight months or so. As many of you know, I believe in getting behaviors right before embracing changes in supplementation or prescription drugs.

They contain either much, much more or much, much less. And that melatonin is a potent hormone that has impacts on not just sleep, but on other hormone systems as well. The supplements that I've suggested and that I personally take in order to improve my sleep are magnesium threonate, spelled T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E. And interchangeably with that one could use magnesium bisglycinate. I do consider those interchangeable because both cross into cells and cross the blood brain barrier in much the same way that makes them better candidates for improving sleep than some of the other forms of magnesium. So magnesium threonate, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine, and something called apigenin, which is essentially what you find in camomile that is the reason why camomile can make you sleepy. A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin. The dosages for those et cetera are described in the toolkit for sleep and why some people might want to avoid theanine. I'll just tell you, for those of you that have very intense dreams or that might sleepwalk or have night terrors, you might want to avoid theanine because it can enhance the kind of emotional and elaborate nature of dreams. Other people like that. So I'll take magnesium threonate, theanine, and apigenin as a so-called sleep stack about 30 to 60 minutes prior to sleep. I do"

Now, inositol comes in different forms, but the form that I'm referring to here in terms of enhancing slow-wave sleep is myo-inositol. There are an enormous number of studies on inositol for sake of mental health and for sake of enhancing various aspects of cellular function and for sake of improving sleep.

The title of the paper is The Impact of Myo-Inositol Supplementation on Sleep Quality in Pregnant Women: A Randomized Double-Blind Placebo Controlled Study. Now, as I just told you, the study was carried out on pregnant women, but there have been other studies of inositol on other populations. And the major takeaway from these studies is that inositol can improve the quality of sleep and can adjust the architecture of sleep in ways that make it a great candidate for improving the structure and maybe also the duration of slow-wave sleep in particular.

        "source_doc": "I find that if I'm following a lower carbohydrate diet, which I do from time to time, I sometimes have trouble falling asleep. Or if I eat four to six hours prior to bedtime, then I tend to be pretty hungry around bedtime. And sometimes if I'm exercising very hard or if I'm working a lot, even if I eat dinner around seven and I go to sleep around 10:00 PM, I might be a little bit hungry still at 10:00 PM. In that case, I find that taking 900 milligrams of myo-inositol in addition to the other sleep stack that I just described greatly enhances my ability to fall asleep and to get terrific quality sleep. I do monitor my sleep. I do that two ways. I do that these days with my Eight Sleep sleep tracker, and I use a WHOOP sleep tracker when I sleep. The combination of those two taps into different aspects of sleep tracking, heart rate variability, movement, et cetera. In a future episode, we'll talk about what are the best devices for monitoring sleep, which have certain advantages and others have disadvantages. But I certainly see it in the objective data that is from the sleep tracking data. And I also observe subjectively that taking 900 milligrams of inositol prior to sleep, again 30 to 60 minutes prior to sleep, can greatly enhance the ability to fall asleep and for me to stay asleep throughout the night. I also noticed another effect, which is that if I wake up in the middle of the night to use the restroom, which I often do, I find it much easier to fall back asleep. I don't tend to get into kind of looping thought and things of that sort in the middle of the night. And that may relate to the"

        "source_doc": "looping thought and things of that sort in the middle of the night. And that may relate to the fact that myo-inositol has been studied in many cases for its role in controlling anxiety that is for reducing anxiety. And that's one of the reasons, in fact, one of many reasons why people take myo-inositol during the daytime. There are studies of myo-inositol for dealing with anxiety, for sleep as we're discussing now, and even for improving fertility and things of that sort, in particular in women. So again, 900 milligrams of an inositol can be a useful tool. 60 minutes of exercise, as described previously, can be a tool, and certainly avoiding caffeine and alcohol is an excellent tool for enhancing the total amount of slow-wave sleep. Jack had a second part to his question, he asked is having a high level of rapid eye movement sleep and a lower level of deep sleep likely to cause any health issues? And to be honest, it's not really clear that it would cause any specific health issues, although if we think about what the specific roles of slow-wave sleep versus rapid eye movement sleep are, again, rapid eye movement sleep being laden with highly emotional dreams, It's thought to act as a sort of trauma release where people are paralyzed in body and that's a healthy paralysis, they're so-called sleep atonia, but undergoing some pretty emotional stuff within their dreams, and there is a lack of ability for the body to secrete adrenaline during rapid eye movement sleep, that's thought to be important for emotional repair, if you will, during the night. Certainly studies where people have been deprived of rapid eye movement sleep have shown that their ability to manage emotionally during the daytime is reduced. Certainly if you have reduced rapid eye"

        "source_doc": "shown that their ability to manage emotionally during the daytime is reduced. Certainly if you have reduced rapid eye movement sleep for multiple nights, that's going to be the case. The only caveat to that is that there are certain forms of treating depression that involve specifically depriving people of rapid eye movement sleep. That's a whole other story that was covered in the podcast episode with Dr. Nolan Williams. So if you want to learn more as to why that's the case, check out that episode. But because slow-waves sleep, which occurs again during the early part of the night, is when growth hormones is released and when there's this periodic washout of debris within the brain, and to some extent within certain tissues of the body, you could imagine that reduced low-wave sleep would lead to reduced ability to recover from exercise, from injury, maybe even relate to the immune system. However, I am personally not aware of any studies that specifically looked at the ratio of slow-wave sleep to rapid eye movement sleep, and that focused in particular on reduced slow-wave sleep for bodily repair. Those studies might be out there, I was not able to find them. If you are able to find them, please put them in the comment section and I would love to check out those studies. So I don't think that one needs to be overly concerned if you're not getting a balance of slow-wave sleep to rapid eye movement sleep, that's perfect. However, and as I mentioned earlier, it would be good to strive to try and balance the amount of slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep across the entire night. If you think about it, that will also tell you whether or not you're getting sufficient total sleep. And I don't want to open up another set of questions here as I'm about to"

And I don't want to open up another set of questions here as I'm about to close out an answer to this question, but I do often get asked the question whether or not four hours is enough, or six hours is enough, or eight hours is enough. Well, it's impossible to know exactly how much sleep each individual person needs. And of course, each individual person will need a different amount of total sleep depending on the amount of stress and physical strain and various other things they're dealing with in their daily waking life. However, it's generally the case that kids and people that are undergoing puberty and certainly in early infancy need more sleep than adults do. So as you age, you do in fact need less sleep. One good metric of whether or not you are getting enough sleep is whether or not you're sleepy during the daytime or not. If you're falling asleep a lot during the daytime, you're probably not getting enough sleep at night. That's sort of a duh, but it's an important duh to pay attention to. And for those of us, like myself, that need a 20 or 30 minute nap in the afternoon, great. That doesn't necessarily mean you're not getting enough sleep at night. So if you get sleepy enough to want a nap in the afternoon, that's not an indication necessarily that you are not getting enough sleep at night. However, if you're only sleeping four or five hours per night, it's very hard to imagine that you're getting a balance of slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep. Once you get into the range of sleeping six to eight hours and certainly 8 to 10 hours per night, the probability that you're getting a balance of slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep greatly"

So if I were to throw out a number, I would say for most people, that is for 95% of people out there, getting at least six hours of sleep per night, at least, and ideally more like seven or eight is going to be the goal. However, I've noticed, for instance, for myself, unless I'm exercising extremely intensely or I'm going through a lot of emotional or physical stress in my daily life, getting six and a half to seven hours of sleep per night allows me to feel really good and refreshed throughout the day. And that's especially the case if I get that 20 or 30 minute nap in the afternoon or use NSDR, Non-Sleep Deep Rest. So I hope that answers your question, Jack, and there are, of course, I'm extending the answer to all others who upvoted that question or who might be interested in improving their slow-wave sleep. There are some dos, there are some don'ts that I just described. I suggest trying various things one by one to see what works best for you so you don't necessarily need to leap to doing the 60 minutes of exercise plus the inositol, et cetera. However, I do encourage everyone to avoid alcohol and caffeine within the 8 to 12 hours prior to sleep.

First of all, it's to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which of course will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length. We are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast. And to fund research, in particular, research done on human beings, so not animal models, but on human beings, which I think we all agree is a species that we are most interested in. And we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance. And those protocols will be distributed through all channels, not just the premium channel, but through all channels, Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. So the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now, an especially exciting feature of the Premium channel is that the Tiny Foundation has generously offered to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel.

        "source_doc": "The first question today is about adaptogens. Some of you may have heard of adaptogens. I'm guessing many of you have not heard of adaptogens. The strict definition of adaptogens is still evolving. Meaning, no one really knows what adaptogens mean and what's included in adaptogens and what's excluded from adaptogens. But the most common definition of an adaptogen is a compound that is typically a supplement or a drug. Although, it could be a behavior, if you really think about it, that helps you adapt to and buffer stress. So when you hear about adaptogens, there are three main categories of adaptogens that come to mind. The first are things that are contained in food. So these would be vitamins or micronutrients that one could easily find in food. But one would have to consume a fairly restricted number or type of foods in order to obtain those things, or consume a lot of those foods in order to get sufficient dosages of those adaptogen compounds in order to buffer stress. Some good examples of these would"

        "source_doc": "Some good examples of these would be any kind of vitamin, either water-soluble or fat-soluble, that can adjust or reduce what are so-called reactive oxygen species. And then that's what gives rise to this idea that antioxidants are good for us. Now, over the last 10 years or so, there's been a shift. What shift has occurred? Well, about 10 years ago, you often heard about antioxidants, antioxidants, antioxidants and vitamins, antioxidants in this food, this superfood, et cetera. And why were people talking about antioxidants? Well, just to remind you, reactive oxygen species are types of reactions and molecules that occur in cells when cells get stressed and/or age. And antioxidants are the compounds that reduce those reactive oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species are bad for cells because they tend to hinder the function of mitochondria, which are associated with energy production in those cells. So what do we know for sure? We know that as cells get older, or as any cell or biological system organ tissue, et cetera, get stressed a lot over time, the number of reactive oxygen species increases in those cells and tissues and organs. And antioxidants, which can include certain vitamins but also some micronutrients, are effective in reducing those reactive oxygen species. Now, what's occurred over the last 10 years"

        "source_doc": "Now, what's occurred over the last 10 years is that we know that reactive oxygen species are a major source of depleting cellular function by way of depleting mitochondrial function. But they are just one of many mechanisms that can deplete cellular function mitochondrial function. So nowadays, you'll hear about reactive oxygen species and antioxidants, but not as much as you used to. Now, you hear a lot more about inflammatory responses and inflammatory cytokines also being an issue. And the truth is all of these things are an issue. So going back to this question about adaptogens, adaptogens include these three categories. I've told you the first, which are the vitamins and micronutrients that are contained in food that can reduce reactive oxygen species and other aspects of cell or stress, such as inflammatory cytokines. What are some of those things that occur in foods? Well, in order to answer that, let's just think about what sorts of foods, themselves, can act as adaptogens. It's commonly held that the dark, leafy greens type foods, for those of you that eat plants. And I think the majority of people out there do eat plants. I know that the carnivore diet and lion diet and some other diets tend to exclude plants, and we'll address that briefly at some point in today's discussion. But dark, leafy greens are known to contain a number of compounds in the form of vitamins and micronutrients that are very effective in reducing reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines. So if you're somebody who's interested in adaptogens and adaptogenic processes, reducing stress and buffering stress, which, of course, has its role in buffering daily stress in order to help you sleep better to improve cellular function for longevity sports performance, cognitive performance, that is all good and it makes sense"

        "source_doc": "But remember that the two main adaptogens that you should think to first are going to be behaviors and nutrition. I started with nutrition on purpose. As I mentioned, we'll get to behaviors in a moment. So if you're interested in adaptogens at all, I highly recommend that you include at least two to four servings of dark, leafy greens and/or cruciferous vegetables per day. I think that would be highly advantageous. And just be aware that excessively heating dark, leafy greens or cruciferous vegetables can actually destroy the very nutrients and micronutrients that act in an adaptogenic way. That does not mean that you need to eat raw broccoli or cauliflower, just the thought of that makes me nauseous, it's very hard to digest. Some people might like that or can digest it more easily than others. So it's perfectly fine to cook your cruciferous vegetables and dark leafy greens, but you don't want to overcook them. What's overcooking and what's undercooking? There's no strict cutoff in terms of temperature. But basically, what the literature says is that if you heat vegetables to the point where the colored fluid is leaching out of them into a broth type, into water or whatever fluid surrounds them, well, then you would be well off to ingest that fluid as well because it contained in the water or the fluid that's leaching out from the cruciferous vegetables or from the dark leafy greens, are going to be a lot of those very adaptogenic molecules that you're interested in the first place. OK. So I probably surprised some people"

        "source_doc": "So I probably surprised some people by starting off my answer to the question of \"What are adaptogens? Are they worth thinking about in pursuing? And if so, how can I get them?\" by talking about food. But I think it is important to understand that you can get a lot of adaptogens from food. And indeed, some of the best adaptogens do come from dark leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables. So I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that. The other two categories of adaptogens are going to be supplement-based adaptogens and then behavioral adaptogens. Again, here adaptogen defined as anything that can buffer stress in a substantial or meaningful way in order to support cellular health, organ health, and overall daily living and functioning, including sleep and performance in mental health. So the second category of adaptogens are going to be supplements. And here, again, I just want to take a step back, make sure that we are clear about our operational definition about what a supplement is. We had an episode all about how to design a rational guide to supplementation, which included, for example, the idea that for some people, the optimal dosage of many supplements is going to be zero. And for other people, the dosage will be something else. But to really pinpoint the key message from that episode that I'd like to reiterate now, but a key message from that episode that I'd like to reiterate now is that many people think of supplements as just vitamin supplements. And for that reason, you'll often hear the argument, \"Oh, well, aren't supplements just expensive urine. Couldn't you get all of that from food?\" Aren't you just urinating out all the water-soluble vitamins and maybe even storing excess amounts of the fat-soluble vitamins in a way that's unhealthy"

When we talk about supplements, yes, it can include vitamin supplements. However, there are many compounds that we would describe as supplements that are not vitamin supplements, and that you could not obtain from food or that you could never obtain from food in sufficient enough qualities to have a robust positive biological effect without consuming an enormous number of calories or overriding your gut mechanically. For instance, if there were, say, a herb, and we'll talk about such herbs in a moment, that contained an effective adaptogen, but you would never want to eat the plant itself or include that herb in any kind of recipe, well then, chances are this herb, which we'll define in a moment, is not a vitamin supplement. It is probably not even best thought of as a supplement, it's best thought of as a compound that sold over the counter, much like a prescription drug."

So there are a lot of things like that we include under the umbrella of this word supplements. And unfortunately, because of that, a lot of people think, \"Oh, you don't need supplements.\" And, of course, you don't need supplements per se, but many people do derive tremendous benefit from them. In the context of adaptogens, there are two or three in particular that can be very beneficial for buffering the stress response, especially, over short periods of time of about two to three weeks. So when would you use these? Well, for instance, if you are in a particularly stressful mode of life, either because of family or relational or school or work demands or new kid in the house or-- any number of different things, or you've been ill or you're recovering from injury, taking an adaptogen in the form of a supplement can actually be very useful for buffering this hormone and the general system is associated with, called cortisol. It's very healthy to have high levels of cortisol early in the day, shortly after you wake up. And then that ought to taper off toward the afternoon and evening. However, if cortisol is chronically elevated throughout the day, or if that peak in cortisol is arriving too late in the day, that is known to be associated with mental health and physical health issues. Has been shown by labs at Stanford and elsewhere. It's been shown in animal models and in humans. Talked many times before, and I'll just remind you again. One of the best ways to restrict that cortisol peak to the early part of the day is to get morning sunlight in your eyes as soon as you can. Once"

Don't wear sunglasses, look at it for five to 30 minutes. Definitely blink so you don't damage your eyes, so on and so forth. Why five minutes or 30 minutes? Well, five minutes on a clear day should be sufficient, longer would be fine. Again, blink so that you protect your eyes. Blink as needed. Face in the general direction of the sun. On days when you have a lot of overcast or it's really dark, dense cloud cover, well, then, you'd want to be outside longer. And if you don't have access to sunlight for whatever reason, then you want to do the same thing with bright artificial lights indoors, either so-called SAD lamp or otherwise. That's a great way to restrict that cortisol peak to early in the day. But even if you're doing that, if you have a stressful life for whatever reason, even if you're getting that morning sunlight, which I hope you are, you're getting your exercise, you're trying to sleep better and more as we all should most of the time, well, then you may be somebody who wants to take a adaptogen in the form of a supplement. And the three supplements that can be very effective in buffering cortisol are ashwagandha, which I'll talk about first, lion's mane and chaga. Lion's mane and chaga are in the fungi group, so they count as mushrooms."

        "source_doc": "so they count as mushrooms. They are not psychedelic mushrooms. Let's talk about ashwagandha first. Ashwagandha is at the top of the list because it is indeed a very potent adaptogen. How can I say that? Well, there are a number of studies now, including several excellent ones in humans, that report that taking two doses of 300 milligrams of ashwagandha per day can, very dramatically, buffer cortisol. So this is something that you would have a near-impossible time accessing from food. I can't imagine that, unless you're cooking with the very sources of ashwagandha and extracting exact amounts that you'd be able to get this in any other form except supplement form. So here I'm going to just briefly reference a paper and we can provide a reference link to this, that is. This is a paper from 2012 that's had a lot of excellent follow-up papers that support it. The title of the paper is A prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of safety and efficacy of high concentration of full spectrum extract of ashwagandha root in reducing stress and anxiety in adults. And it's a really nice study. Not a huge subject pool, but both men and women, and has carried out for long enough that they got to see some really interesting results. And I think the most interesting result is that taking 300 milligrams of ashwagandha twice a day led to enormous-- I mean, just enormous changes in serum cortisol. The statistical significance that they observed in the study was really fantastic, fantastically high statistical significance. They saw the effects of ashwagandha on day 15, having initiated the ashwagandha consumption on day one, of course, day"

So subjective stress and cortisol levels. So ashwagandha is very potent at reducing cortisol. How would you recapitulate this if you wanted to use ashwagandha to buffer stress? Well, a couple of key points. I mentioned earlier that you want your cortisol peak to come earlier in the day. Therefore, you would not want to buffer cortisol early in the day. In fact, cortisol peaking early in the day provides an anti-inflammatory immune-supporting, focus and mood supporting effect all day long. So I would recommend that people take their first dose of ashwagandha anywhere from 250 to 300 milligrams. Sometime in the early afternoon and again in the evening, as opposed to taking a morning dose in an afternoon dose. Also, if you're somebody who's exercising for sake of trying to induce adaptations like hypertrophy, the growth of muscles or strength, or improve your endurance in any way, muscular endurance or more traditional cardiovascular endurance, then I recommend that you not take your ashwagandha prior to exercise because part of the adaptation response is triggered by increases in cortisol during exercise. Sort of in the same way that some of the best adaptations to exercise are reductions in blood pressure and resting heart rate. And those are stimulated by increases in blood pressure and increases in heart rate during exercise. That's just how these biological systems work. So the takeaway is pretty simple. If you're interested in using ashwagandha as an adaptogen, I would restrict it to later in the day if you can and not before exercise. Divide it"

        "source_doc": "I would restrict it to later in the day if you can and not before exercise. Divide it into two doses of 250 to 300 milligrams. That's what this paper and other papers like it seem to indicate. And then a very important final point about ashwagandha, which is that if you're going to take ashwagandha, I recommend not taking it for longer than a month-and-a-half as they did in this study. In fact, I would suggest that you only take ashwagandha around periods of moderate to extreme stress. What's moderate, what's extreme is going to depend on what you're going through. Only how much stress and life events you can tolerate. So if you've had trouble sleeping and that's unusual for you. Or, you're dealing with a very difficult life circumstances or excessive work demand, or a new kid, as I mentioned before. Well, then buffering stress with ashwagandha, buffering cortisol in the afternoon and evening can be very beneficial for you. But then I would say after about 30 days maximum, I would take at least two to four weeks off. Two weeks is probably enough, but four weeks off because you don't want to chronically buffer cortisol. It's just not a good idea. But that said, I think ashwagandha is a very powerful adaptogen. I would place at the top of the list of supplement-based adaptogens. But keep in mind that even if you're taking a supplement-based adaptogen, that's no reason to abandon the nutrition and behavioral type adaptogenic effects that you can create through eating dark leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables, then we'll talk about the behaviors in a moment.

And I get asked a lot about lion's mane and chaga for sake of their purported roles in acting as nootropics as quote unquote \"smart drugs.\" There are fewer data on the beneficial roles of lion's mane and chaga for sake of nootropic effects-- we'll do an entire episode on nootropics at some point. But there have been a few studies showing that lion's made in supplementation and chaga supplementation can improve memory, and maybe even divergent thinking associated with creativity and things of that sort. Again, these are not psychedelic mushrooms. That said, there are good data showing that 1,000 milligrams, that is 1 gram, of lion's mane per day and/or-- I will talk about the end/or portion in a moment, and/or chaga mushroom at 500 to 1,500 milligrams per day can act as adaptogens in, again, reducing cortisol. But also and mainly reducing some of the anti-inflammatory cytokines that are known to circulate in high abundance when you're under a lot of psychological and/or physical stress. Things like interleukin 6 and some related molecules. So here's what I would recommend. If you are interested in exploring adaptogens, I'm a big fan, as some of you probably know, if you heard that episode on rational guide to supplementation. I'm a big fan of mainly focusing on taking supplements in single-ingredient formulations so that you can figure out what dosages are best for you, and so that you can toggle in and out those adaptogens as needed. So I, of course, am a fan of taking certain blends and mixes, the one that we talk about a lot"

Although, the levels of ashwagandha that are contained in Athletic Greens are low enough that I don't see any issue with taking Athletic Greens consistently, day to day, every day, because you're not getting anywhere near that 600-milligram dosage. But the idea is that if you were going to take any adaptogen for sake of buffering stress over the short term, say for a week or two weeks or a month, and then taking that recommended time off, I would start with ashwagandha. And then if you feel you need something else to buffer stress, keeping in mind, of course, that you're doing the behavioral and the nutritional things to buffer stress as well. You can never abandon those, right? Well, then I would suggest adding 1,000 milligrams or 1,000 milligrams of chaga per day and seeing how that further benefits your system in terms of buffering stress. How would you measure if your stress is being reduced? Well, you're going to be sleeping better at night. You're going to feel subjectively better, lower levels of anxiety. All the things that are measured in the types of studies I described before. Now, of course, there's nothing preventing you from taking 600 milligrams of ashwagandha, a gram of lion's mane, and a gram of chaga.

If, however, you're taking them every day, I recommend that you cycle off them after a period of 30 days or so. And I want to be very clear about this, just because I said cycle off after a period of 30 days or so does not mean that you can't take them for a shorter period of time. So for instance, if you know that you're coming up on a big week of stress, well, then you could take ashwagandha and/or lion's mane and/or chaga for that week or just that week or heading into that week or in the following week and then stop. There's no reason why you couldn't take them even just for one day. Although, the effects tend to be a bit cumulative, at least, when we're talking about buffering anxiety. In terms of buffering cortisol, that's a very potent effect that as far as we know, is going to take place on day one. Again, keep that cortisol buffering effect away from exercise. At least, don't take it before exercise. And try and buffer your cortisol in the afternoon and evening, and this is assuming that you're working a conventional shift and you're not up all night and sleeping all day for sake of shift work. So hopefully, that clarifies things about what adaptogens are. In fact, I never actually read the specific question, but I think I've touched on a number of issues that were related to the specific question.

        "source_doc": "to behavioral tools that can act as adaptogens. The question, itself, was there's a lot of mixed information out there about adaptogens like ashwagandha. And I think that relates to what I said earlier, which is that the definition of an adaptogen has not really been cemented in various communities. It's different in different communities, and it's generally used as a matter of convenience rather than really strictly defining what it is. And hopefully, we've defined it accurately and broadly enough today as something that buffers stress. The second part of the question was what does the scientific evidence say about adaptogens and their ability to mediate body stress response? They say quite a lot, and they say that the stress response can be buffered substantially by certain adaptogens. Mainly, dark leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables, ashwagandha, lion's mane, and chaga, and of course, all the behavioral things that are critical that I will list off in a moment. And then the third portion of the question is, is there any solid evidence that has an effect on neurotransmitters or the HPA, which is part of the stress modulation access? The best evidence is that adaptogens can reduce cortisol itself. There is very little evidence that adaptogens can directly modulate neurotransmitters or neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, et cetera. But by adjusting the timing and levels of cortisol, especially in the afternoon and evening, that is going to have indirect effects on levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, et cetera, and serotonin. But not direct effects. So the general contour that makes for an ideal diurnal schedule-- you heard of nocturnal, well, the opposite that is diurnal, being awake during the daytime and asleep at night."

        "source_doc": "well, the opposite that is diurnal, being awake during the daytime and asleep at night. The ideal kind of landscape of neurotransmitters is higher levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine in the early part of the day and cortisol, so-called catecholamines, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. And high levels of cortisol early in the day as directed by sunlight, exercise, caffeine, hydration, movement, all that stuff, being awake and busy and outside or indoors with bright lights and moving about in the early part of the day and into the early afternoon, that's the best possible way that we are aware of to try and get those catecholamines released at the highest levels in the early part of the day. And then the ideal contour of a 24-hour cycle will be in the later half of the day. The evening and nighttime, you have higher levels of things like serotonin the GABAergic system, all the things that are somewhat sedative in preparing you for sleep and lower levels of the catecholamines and cortisol as I described before. So to directly answer the question, \"Is there any evidence that adaptogens can alter your neurotransmitters?\" Yes, but only indirectly. And yet, that indirect control over neurotransmitters is substantial and is important. And if you do what I described, such as getting morning sunlight and ideally, you'd get a little bit of deliberate cold water exposure, by the way, to boost adrenaline and norepinephrine and dopamine, those catecholamines early in the day. So quick one-minute cold shower, even or a three-minute cold shower, or if you have access to an ice bath early in the day, plus some sunlight, doesn't matter which one you do"

I can't emphasize how beneficial all of that can be. And exercise, if you can, early end of the day. Some people can't exercise till later in the day. I'd rather see people exercise later in the day than not at all, provided it does not disrupt their nighttime sleep, which of course, sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance.

        "source_doc": "So yes, there is modulation of neurotransmitters, but most of those are downstream of the effects on cortisol that we've been talking about. So we've defined nutritional adaptogens, supplement-based adaptogens-- although, I don't really like the word supplements anymore unless we're talking about vitamin supplements for reasons we talked about earlier. And then there's the third category of adaptogens, which are the behavioral tools that you can use to buffer stress, which qualifies those as an adaptogen. I think it's really important that we always keep in mind that yes, there are supplements, yes, there are prescription drugs out there. In fact, there are prescription drugs that you can get from a doctor that will potently zero out your cortisol. But most doctors are very reluctant to prescribe those drugs because cortisol provides a very important and functional role early in the day. Behaviors are very effective at reducing cortisol. What are the most effective behaviors to reduce cortisol? Well, we talked about, one, to restrict cortisol the early part of the day, which is viewing morning sunlight. But how would you buffer cortisol in the late afternoon? It's going to be all the things associated with reducing stress. For instance, 10 minutes or even-- my laboratory and other laboratories have shown is even five minutes a day of just what would be called mindfulness meditation, very simple. You don't need to overcomplicate this. You could use a great app like the Waking Up app or another app of the sort. Or, you can simply sit down, eyes closed, breathe through your nose, and just concentrate on your breathing. Every time your mind drifts to something else, bring it back to your breathing. That's shown to reduce stress. You could do a five-minute deliberate breath work practice. My laboratory has published some work related to"

You could also use box breathing, inhale, hold, exhale, hold for equal durations for a period of five minutes, will substantially reduce stress. I'm a big fan, as many of you know, of yoga nidra, which involves no movement. It involves just lying there, listening to a script. Lots of yoga or scripts available online. If you're not interested in the intentions and other things, including yoga nidra, you can buffer stress using an adaptogen like NSDR, non-sleep deep breast. If you're interested in trying these sorts of things. There's a NSDR protocol that's 10 minutes long. Just put my name, Huberman, and NSDR into the search browser on YouTube. And Virtusan is provided in NSDR that's completely zero cost and works very well for reducing stress. It will also help teach your system and teach you how to learn to fall asleep better at night. So any of those practices, five to 10-minute breathing practice or meditation, or a NSDR yoga nidra. If you can do longer 20 or 30 minutes in the afternoon, that's known to buffer cortisol substantially as well. Any time you're encountering stress in real time, I highly recommend a tool over and over because it's so effective.

I hope I pronounced that correctly, Justine. And thank you for that question. I think there are a lot of people interested in adaptogens. So now, you can use nutrition such as cruciferous vegetables, dark leafy greens. And I should also mention, if you're not ingesting enough calories each day, well, then you are going to be in a mild mode of stress. That's not to say that some people shouldn't take in fewer calories than they burn in order to lose weight, some people really need to do that for their health or for whatever other reason. But if you restrict calories too much, you are going to increase cortisol output. So keep that in mind. So ingest sufficient calories for you and for your goals.

        "source_doc": "Without further ado, let's get to answering your questions. And as always, I will strive to be as accurate as possible, as thorough as possible, and yet, as concise as possible. Our first question is about motivation, in particular, how to maintain motivation over long periods of time. This was the question asked by Martin Zokov. He wrote, \"I alternate between periods of two different states that vary from a few weeks to a couple of months. I have extremely high motivation in one state, where I can do multiple things-- side projects, making music, as well as my main things, or really low-motivational states, where I can barely do anything, and I only look for short term entertainment.\" I'm guessing, short-term entertainment comes in the form of video games, social media, and just doing generally unproductive things, as we all do from time to time. He goes on to write, \"What would be the best set of protocols to normalize those extremes into a more stable and consistent state?\" Well, first off, this is an excellent question. I say that because it's a question that I hear a lot, and I think that many people are interested in knowing how motivated they ought to feel. And I think a lot of people also feel a lot less motivated than they would like. Now, here the question was, specifically, about how to not go from these extremes of days or weeks of high motivation to days or weeks of low motivation. But before we do that, we need to take a step back and acknowledge that, just as with anxiety, or happiness,"

It's certainly one that I've adopted, which is-- for anything in our life, we can either be back on our heels, flat footed, or forward center of mass. Back in our heels, meaning really struggling; flat footed, meaning we're doing OK; or forward center of mass, meaning that we feel as if we're really tackling things and that we are in control of our environment or at least to some degree. So I place that imagery in your mind because I'll return to it a little bit later in the question when we get into some of the underlying circuitry and tools. In the meantime, I want to remind everybody what"

        "source_doc": "In the meantime, I want to remind everybody what the basis of motivation is. There are many neurochemicals and neural circuits involved in what we call motivation, but a central theme of the neuroscience of motivation is that the neural modulator dopamine is involved. Now, dopamine does other things besides control motivation. In fact, it controls light adaptation in the retina, that is your eye. It controls a number of different things in terms of movement. It controls all sorts of things, but it is strongly related to the motivation pathways. How do we know that? Well, there are experiments on animals and humans, which show that even in the absence of dopamine, or in the presence of very low dopamine, I should say, people and animals can still experience pleasure. However, when dopamine levels are too low, people's ability to pursue pleasure, or their willingness to pursue pleasure, in particular, their willingness to undergo effort to pursue pleasure or any goal of any kind, not just pleasure, any goal of any kind, is strongly regulated by the levels of dopamine. So if dopamine levels are too low, people simply will not put in the effort to obtain or reach a goal. If dopamine levels are adequately high, they will put in that effort. And if dopamine levels go too high, you actually see something that is pathologic, which is that people consider every goal a reasonable goal. This is often seen in the manic phase of a manic bipolar person. So for instance, somebody with manic bipolar who is in a manic episode, dopamine levels are very, very high, and they will think every idea is a great idea. And they will have tons of energy to do that, so much so so that they're not sleeping. So obviously, that's not what we want. What we want, and"

And we can really trace that back to a biochemical/neural circuit statement, which is-- we really want to control our output of dopamine and the baseline levels of dopamine from which that output is taken. In other words, we want to think about dopamine as a reservoir or residing in a reservoir."

And one of the best analogies that I've ever heard was by a previous guest on the Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Kyle Gillett, who's a medical doctor, obesity specialist, expert in hormones. We did an episode on optimizing hormones in males with Dr. Kyle Gillett. You can find that at hubermanlab.com or anywhere you can find podcasts. Dr. Gillett offered an analogy of the baseline levels of dopamine as a wave pool, and I really like this. So if you think about this pool full of dopamine-- and here we're just talking about the dopamine that resides in the circuits of the brain that control motivation. But that pool of dopamine you could imagine is just sitting there not doing much of anything while you're asleep. In fact, while you're sleeping, you're replenishing those dopamine levels. I'll tell you another tool in a moment to replenish those dopamine levels. But if you were to pursue a goal, really, really go forward-center of mass for many, many hours or many, many days, in some cases, and pursue a goal or multiple goals and you're really driven to do a ton, what you're effectively doing is generating waves in that wave pool. And if those waves are too big, well, then the waves can't keep repeating themselves. So think about the wave as the motivation and the depth of the pool is the reservoir of dopamine. And if those waves are too big, too much excitement, too much motivation, too much center of mass for a given period of time, then the water in this wave pool sloshes out of the wave pool lowering the"

So for some people, six hours, for some people, eight hours. Some people might even need a little bit more or a little bit less. We have episodes-- the Perfect Your Sleep episode, the Master Your Sleep episode. We have a toolkit for sleep. All available at zero cost at hubermanlab.com, links et cetera. So check those out for getting your sleep right. But sleep is really when you replenish that reservoir of dopamine. So you cannot ignore sleep. I'll come back to this in a moment. The second science supported tool that's really been shown to replenish dopamine, in particular, dopamine within the pathways that regulate motivation, is a practice I've talked about before on the podcast called non-sleep deep rest, sometimes called yoga nidra, although, yoga nidra is a little bit different. There are two studies out of Denmark that have explored yoga nidra in the context of dopamine. The first one simply involved having people do a yoga nidra practice. Again, this doesn't involve any movement, but it involves people, potentially you, doing anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes, although there are now data showing that as short as 10 minutes of a non-sleep deep rest, a.k.a. yoga nidra protocol, leads to dramatic, really dramatic increases in striatal dopamine reserves. So it essentially is replenishing the dopamine reserve pool. This is why I'm such a fan of using NSDR, a.k.a. yoga nidra, at least once a day and especially under times when you're engaging in a lot of high output. And"

And when I say, especially at times when you're engaging in a lot of high output, this is a mistake many people make. They push, push, push, push, push. They're in pursuit of a goal. Then they hit that point where they're exhausted. Then they start doing all the dopamine reserve pool replenishing tools such as yoga nidra or NSDR. The real key is to always tap off that or refill that reservoir once a day before it's completely depleted. Now, this gets into some of the biochemistry of dopamine and the relevant circuits, but it takes a lot longer to restore the dopamine reservoir-- think of it still as a wave pool, but that reservoir from a place of complete depletion then it does of partial depletion. So there's an asymmetry in the way this is done. So it's not as if you drink a glass of water. You fill the glass of water at a certain rate and it fills up to a certain level,"

Think about it as once the level of dopamine in your reserve is depleted past a certain point, it takes a lot more effort, much more sleep, much more NSDR, things of that sort to replenish that reservoir. Now, oftentimes what people will do when they start feeling less motivation is they will start relying on things like Adderall, Ritalin, some cases illegal substances that can increase dopamine. You know what those are. Please don't ever lean in to those. They are extremely dangerous. They really are because of their ability to potently release dopamine. And guess what, deplete that reservoir even further. We've talked about some supplements on the podcast that can replenish dopamine, L-tyrosine in particular. Mucuna pruriens is actually 99% l-DOPA, the precursor to dopamine. I don't necessarily recommend Mucuna pruriens. It tends to make people very dopaminergic-- drive, drive, drive, drive, motivated, and then crash. Again, depleting that pool. L-tyrosine is a little bit milder. But I really encourage people to lean first on the behavioral tools such as an NSDR. And by the way, there's a NSDR script, totally zero cost, that you can find by putting my name and NSDR into YouTube. That one works quite well if you are looking for a short NSDR. There are some other NSDRs. You can simply look on the internet or YouTube and just put NSDR and you'll find NSDR.

Many people think NSDR or yoga nidra are simply meditation with a body scan. That's not true. Meditation is a focus exercise. Most meditations are focus exercise. NSDR restores energy through the dopamine system, and newer data are starting to show that it can actually recover lost sleep, so if you're not sleeping enough. But to return to NSDR, a.k.a. yoga nidra, as a practice, yes, it's been shown in laboratory studies, in humans, by the way, to restore dopamine levels. There's another study, lesser known, from that same group that was published in 2011, which is entitled Dopaminergic stimulation enhances confidence and accuracy in seeing rapidly presented words. This was a cognitive task. They explored yoga nedra, a.k.a. NSDR, in the context of increasing striatal dopamine. They already knew that it did that, so that's great. They confirmed that result. But what they also found is that doing NSDR could restore confidence in cognitive ability and performance in these cognitive tasks. So this is a really powerful, zero cost tool for re-upping or replenishing that dopamine reserve. So this is something to do every day, especially when you're not feeling depleted.

I always say, 80% or more of the nights of your life, hopefully the nights that it's not good, are for good reasons that you're enjoying yourself. But hey, life happens, so 100% of the time it's just not reasonable to expect of yourself. Do NSDR once a day for either 10 minutes. If you have the time to do 20-30 minutes or an hour, you will see even more positive effects. It has been shown in these research studies to replenish dopamine, levels of confidence, cognitive ability, et cetera, and sense of motivation. And I said there were three tools, and the third tool that really can allow you to keep the dopamine, a.k.a. motivation circuitry, tuned up properly is to really start paying attention to peaks in dopamine and be very careful about layering in too many things that can stimulate the dopamine system. I talked about this quite a bit in the episode that we did on ADHD and building and maintaining focus. There are many things out there nowadays that will deplete the dopamine system. For instance-- and by the way, none of what I'm about to list is necessarily bad. I actually used some of these things. For instance, caffeine will increase dopamine receptors that will allow whatever dopamine is available to be more potent. OK, so caffeine is great for some people, less good for people with anxiety. Don't drink it too late in the day because it will interfere with your sleep, and so on and so forth. But many people will combine caffeine with music that they particularly like. Music's"

It can enhance motivation, especially if is the kind of music that really puts you in the groove for the particular type of work you're going to do. For me, I like to listen to either loud fast music or Glenn Gould classical piano, so one or the other. I know what's right for me for a given time. You'll know what's right for you for a given time and your preferences. But what will happen is people will start consuming caffeine at higher and higher levels. Again, caffeine isn't necessarily bad, but they'll start doing that. And they'll start layering it in, or stacking, very potent music, potent for them, plus things like L-tyrosine. Again, none of these things are terrible on their own. In fact, they can be very beneficial. Sometimes they'll start taking Mucuna pruriens. Sometimes they'll start relying on things like Adderall, Ritalin. And pretty soon what's happening is they're getting these big waves in that dopamine wave pool, big peaks. And within a few days or maybe even within a few hours, they're depleted and they're at that low. And then, as Dr. Anna Lembke, who is a guest on the podcast, talked about in terms of addiction but also in her wonderful book Dopamine Nation, what happens is after those big peaks in dopamine, the reservoir, the baseline in dopamine, drops below its initial level. So it's as if the reservoir got deeper, and it's emptier, and it takes much, much longer to fill. So to be quite specific, what"

Ideally, every night of your life, but for as many nights of your life as possible. That's clearly replenishing dopamine and sense of motivation. Do all the things associated with that-- morning, sunlight, lack of artificial light at certain hours of the night, et cetera. All of that's in the Toolkit for Sleep and other episodes I mentioned before. Have a practice that is research supported to replenish dopamine, and incorporate that practice any time of day. Again, NSDR can be done morning, afternoon, or evening, or middle of the night if you wake up and you need to get back to sleep, it can be very beneficial for that.

Yes, please do celebrate and enjoy the wonderful events of life, but please also understand and expect there will be a lull, a sort of postpartum low, maybe not full blown depression, that follows that unless you incorporate some tools and practices to replenish that dopamine. Does that mean you should never combine caffeine, L-tyrosine, music, and a workout, and time with friends? No, absolutely not. But don't expect to do that, and then go do an intense bout of work, and then get up the next morning and do it all over again for more than a few days before you find yourself pretty depleted. So rather than give you a specific schedule of do seven days of this and four days of this, what I encourage you to do is, for at least five days a week-- maybe give yourself some time off on the weekends, maybe not. But for at least five days a week, get into a consistent routine that is, I should say, neurobiologically consistent as well with how the dopamine, a.k.a. circuits that control motivation, work. And I assure you that you will find yourself in a more regular groove of focus, and attention, and alertness, and motivation when you need to. And provided you're doing all the things I described, and hopefully paying attention to other things like nutrition and social connection too, of course, you'll find a much more even pattern of motivation over time."

When I was in graduate school, I got some wonderful advice from an excellent neurologist. His name is Robert Knight. He used to be at University of California, Berkeley. I think he's retired now but is still active in the scientific community. And I asked him what he was doing that weekend. I don't know why this came up. And he said, oh, I'm going fishing. I like mindless recreation. I said, that's great. You know, fishing is fun. I'm not particularly into fishing myself, but I've done it a few times and I enjoy it. And he said, the most important thing for a science or medicine career or any demanding career? I said, what? I was all ears, super hungry to get in the mix and do research and publish papers. And he said, figure out how many hours a day you can do real work consistently. That means five days a week, for some people six or seven, but five days a week I think for most people is going to be a bit healthier overall for your social life and family, et cetera. And he said, figure that out, and know that that number is what you should apply over, and over, and over again, but update that number about every four or five years. And I said, OK, so does that mean that over time I'm working more and more or less and less? And he said, ah, here's the deal-- as you get better at your profession, you will find that you can do more potent work, more directed work, in a shorter amount of time,"

In fact, the opposite. So this follows a sort of general principle that's also present in resistance training, weightlifting, right? The analogy there is that people always imagine that as you get better and better at resistance training that you should do more and more volume, just keep adding volume. And there's some evidence to support that. More volume for hypertrophy as opposed to less, et cetera. We've done episodes on this. However, there's a different school of thought that works exceedingly well, and it runs in the exact opposite direction, which is as you get better at controlling muscular contractions-- or let's say for in an endurance sport, as you get better at regulating your stride, and breathing, and all those things, you actually can do more \"adaptation\" stimulating damage during a given training session. So you want to train less not more over time because beginners don't actually have the ability to get much done in a lot of time or a short period of time, whereas, experts can come in there and really nail it. So I think that advice that Robert Knight was really key, and it's something that I've followed throughout my career. So at one period of my life, I won't mention the hours that I worked in graduate school, they were pretty insane to be honest. I had family members get a little concerned.

And in answering this question, we're going to skirt right up against a topic that I've covered before on the podcast which is obsessive compulsive disorder, which is a very serious disorder. I mean, it can have a range of severity, but people with true OCD suffer a lot from obsessions, these are intrusive thoughts, and compulsions, which are the behaviors typically associated with those thoughts. I think it's really important that we define OCD really clearly so that we can make sure that we're talking about intrusive thoughts and the desire to abstain from thoughts versus OCD and where there might be some overlap there.

But true OCD is a situation in which engaging in a particular compulsive behavior does not serve to reduce the intensity or the frequency of the obsessions. In fact, it makes it worse. So the typical thing that we hear these days is oh, you're so OCD, or he's so OCD, or she's so OCD, or I'm so OCD. Now if someone is OCD in that sense, OK, so not the clinical disorder but OCD in the sense that they're really clean, they're really fastidious, they need everything perfect. However, that person can achieve some level of calm and comfort that's fairly long lasting if everything's clean and perfect, well, then that's not obsessive compulsive disorder. This is really important to understand as we venture into answering the question about intrusive thoughts and the desire to abstain from certain thoughts. A person with true OCD will keep cleaning and cleaning,"

A person who has more typical, gosh, we don't really even have a language for this nowadays unfortunately, but the sort of person that's extremely particular, they need things a certain way, and they're very driven to resolve things and do things to make sure that things are done in a certain way, or handled in a certain way, well, if that person can experience relief from engaging in let's say, exercise, or from cleaning, you'd say you're so OCD about exercise. Well, but if exercising for an hour or even two hours in the morning make somebody really calm the rest of the day and they don't need to exercise well, then they're not necessarily true OCD. They don't necessarily have a disorder related to exercise. However, if they're exercising for two hours in the morning and then they find they can't concentrate on other things and their desire to exercise just increases and increases and becomes intrusive for them disrupting their quality of life throughout the day, well, then that's falling under the umbrella of what we would call a true disorder.

However, of course, in the instance of food or in some other addictions, you can't abstain for 30 days. That would be terrible to abstain for food for 30 days.

        "source_doc": "and let's start off by asking ourselves, what is a thought? In the realm of neurobiology, we have sensations which are the processes by which our neurons, nerve cells convert light, photons, sound waves, touch, mechanical pressure, et cetera into electrical signals and chemical signals that head into our nervous system, including our brain. And then our brain, at least we think, make sense of them, and help us navigate the world that we're in. So the sensation part is a pure transformation of mechanical information, or in some cases, chemical information like smell. Literally, volatile chemicals floating around in the world are brought in through your nose and your neurons and your olfactory bulb convert those into electrical and chemical signals that your brain can understand. Perceptions are your idea of what those signals out in the world are. Either because you're paying attention to them, or for some other reason you decide that stop sign in front of you is red, and that the sign behind it is white, and that the sky is blue or cloudy, those are perceptions. So we have sensations and perceptions. Then we have emotions which are these things that include the mind and body that are related to neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, et cetera, although, those chemicals do other things as well. And then, of course, we have behaviors, actions. Everything from me moving my pen on a piece of paper to walking, running, et cetera. Thoughts are a fifth category of neural functioning that we really need to define, but that doesn't have as strict a definition as sensations, perceptions, or feeling, or action. But thoughts are real. We all know this. Thoughts are real, and one way that we can define thoughts is that thoughts are perceptions that include data from the past, present, or future, or combinations of past and"

        "source_doc": "So thoughts are perceptions that are generated internally. We don't need any external sensation in order to have a thought. We can close our eyes. We could be in sensory isolation for that matter. We could even be floating with no gravity, and we can have a thought. Thoughts tend to run pretty much automatically in the background all the time. Some people refer to this as chatter in the back of our minds in a very unstructured way. And then if we force our thoughts to be structured because we decide they need to be, or if something in our environment captures our perception, then our thoughts tend to be structured. Let me give you an example. If I'm just walking around, if there were a way in which we could broadcast my thoughts onto a screen, I hope we wouldn't do that. But those thoughts would be a mixture of semi-complete sentences and gibberish. However if somebody stops me, and says, hi. Good to see you. What are you doing today? And I start answering, well, then my thoughts are suddenly being driven by an external stimulus, their question, and some internal ideas, memory of who I am and what I'm doing that day so past and present, and so on. And so thoughts become structured. So when we have a question about how to abstain from thoughts, we need to be additionally specific and really pinpoint that what we're trying to do is to abstain from thoughts we don't want presumably, either because they are too repetitive and distracting, or because what's contained in those thoughts is disturbing. This is important because it gives us two answers to the questions that are highly divergent. One answer to the question of how to abstain from intrusive thoughts, thoughts that were addicted to, is if those thoughts are merely on loop all the time and we can't stop them, but the thoughts themselves aren't particularly"

So think about a song you can't get out of your head, or you keep recounting some event, but the event itself isn't very disturbing. It's just intrusive because it's there. Well, in that case, the data really point to trying to anchor your thoughts to some external stimulus. So getting into action, getting into activities that really draw your attention away from that thought. Now you may still hear it scrolling in the background, so you might be sitting in class still hearing that loop of thoughts in the background. That's something that over time ought to wane, it ought to disappear if we try and bring more and more attention to whatever it is that's in our environment, whatever it is that we happen to be learning or doing physically, et cetera. Things like mindful meditation."

        "source_doc": "Things like mindful meditation. Doing a 10 or even just 5 minute a day practice of sitting with eyes closed, or lying down with eyes closed and really focusing on one's breath, focusing one's attention on sometimes called the third eye center, but in science we'd say just the region right behind the forehead, you're directing your attention there, has been shown to increase focus for singular topics and can improve memory and do a bunch of other things as well. Those are data from Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab at New York University. She was a guest on the podcast as well. My laboratory has run studies on mindful meditation as well. So what you're really trying to do is learn how to focus better on one thing, and by focusing on that one thing, you focus off these repetitive thoughts. Now, I have a feeling that this question was asked and that many people upvoted this question because the issue isn't just thoughts that are intrusive because they're there and on repeat, but because the thoughts themselves are actually troubling. This could be recounting a trauma, someone harmed you, you observed something that was disturbing, you felt wronged, you felt someone else was wronged, you can't seem to get your mind off of something, and your emotions tend to follow, and so it's uncomfortable. I have a feeling this is the root of the question. In that case, the approach is very different. What we know from essentially all of the quality scientific and clinical studies is that those sorts of intrusive thoughts are very much like a trauma. Now we have to be clear in defining what trauma is. I'll use the definition that Dr. Paul Conti, another incredible guest that was on our podcast. A Stanford-Harvard trained psychiatrist. I think one of the world's foremost leaders on the issue of trauma and psychiatry and psychology generally."

        "source_doc": "think one of the world's foremost leaders on the issue of trauma and psychiatry and psychology generally. He defines trauma as an event or something that fundamentally changes the way that your nervous system works such that you function less adaptively going forward from that event. So not every bad occurrence in your life is a trauma. That's good news. The bad news is many people have traumas, and traumas change the way that our nervous system works so that we don't function as well as we could. So in that sense, intrusive thoughts that are disturbing are in many ways traumas and are reinforcing that trauma. Now, we know that almost counterintuitively in order to deal with trauma, you have to get very close to that trauma. You don't have to reexpose, and I would hope you would not reexpose yourself to the very same trauma. But we know that one of the best ways to deal with traumas is to get very clear about the narrative around those traumas. Now this can be done with a therapist ideally, but not everyone has access to therapy or can afford therapy. There's a range of quality of therapists for that matter, so we're always referring to the desire for people to do great therapy with really great, meaning excellently trained people. But it turns out that if you want to extinguish an intrusive thought, one of the best ways to do that is to journal about that particular thought extensively. So rather than the earlier strategy for intrusive thoughts where they're just on loop, and intrusive because they're on loop and present, but their content isn't disturbing, when that thought is disturbing and intrusive, we know that it's very useful to script out as much detail about that particular thought and the things around it as possible. Now obviously, you want to do this in a way that is fairly structured. So you ideally"

        "source_doc": "Now obviously, you want to do this in a way that is fairly structured. So you ideally would use complete sentences. So the reason for doing that is that thoughts, as I mentioned earlier, can often be fragmentary. So they pop up in our mind almost we seemingly spontaneously. They're inhibiting our ability to focus, or be present at work, or family, or other things, or sleep. Writing things down in a lot of detail does seem to have this quality of both reducing the emotional load of whatever it is that thought is about, as well as diminishing the frequency of those intrusive thoughts over time. So this is far and away different than the strategy I mentioned for the other types of intrusive thoughts. And really it's far and away different from the 30-day abstinence approach that Dr. Anna Lembke was talking about for substance or behavioral addictions. Now, of course, this process of abstaining from thoughts or removing the addictive nature of certain thoughts can definitely take some time. So a good example there would be superstitions. I'll come clean here, and I've talked about this before on a few podcasts that when I was in college, I developed a knock on wood superstition. Any time I'd say something that I didn't want to happen or did want to happen, I'd say, knock on wood, and I'd knock on wood. And then I started suppressing the behavior mostly because it was a little embarrassing. And then I started just telling myself in my head, knock on wood, knock on wood, knock on wood. And it was clearly a little bit of an OCD type thing, but again, OCD in air quotes here. I think it qualified as OCD in the sense that the more I did it, the more I wanted to do it.

And I raise this because a lot of times the intrusive thought is not, OK, I'm thinking about a car accident, or I'm thinking about a breakup, or I'm thinking about an exam that I have. That can be intrusive, but a lot of times it's some kind of nebulous, abstract, set of words, or ideas, or images around something that happened that we saw or heard or experienced. And by putting a lot of clear structure to what the thought is exactly and to putting some thought and structure onto paper about what that pattern of not healthy thinking relates to, people often achieve tremendous relief in a fairly short amount of time. Sometimes just in one session of writing it down, sometimes they need to write it down multiple times. What you're essentially trying to do with a intrusive thought or a trauma of any kind is you're trying to turn a disturbing story, that is a story that evokes a lot of emotion and captures, it hijacks your nervous system, into what is essentially a known but repetitive and old, boring story where the emotional load has been depleted. And there are, of course, I have to highlight the fact that getting sufficient rapid eye movement sleep we also know is very important for removing the emotional load of traumatic experiences and intrusive thoughts. So you really want to strive to get the best possible sleep you can. That includes sufficient rapid eye movement sleep. And we have multiple zero-cost resources for that at hubermanlab.com.

So in order to remove intrusive and addictive thoughts, ask yourself, is this OCD of the classic sense? If it is, you should see a psychiatrist. They won't necessarily prescribe medication, but there are tools for true OCD that are very effective in many cases. And we did the episode on OCD which I invite you to listen to as well. You want to ask yourself, are the thoughts disturbing or merely intrusive and repetitive? If they're merely intrusive and repetitive, well, then learning to focus your attention on other things and getting better at focusing on single things through an exercise like mindfulness, meditation can really help. And indeed perhaps the best use of mindfulness meditation is to improve your level of focus. It does have other benefits as well, but that's going to be the major one that one will experience even with these very short 5 or 10-minute day meditations. Great data on that from the scientific literature. And then if those intrusive thoughts are not only intrusive but they're also disturbing, in that case, you really want to put as much structure and thought, believe it or not, into what those thoughts are really about. Write them out on paper in complete sentences and maybe do that multiple times until the underlying emotions related to those thoughts really start to diminish. And by doing that, you're essentially doing your own form of trauma therapy, for lack of a better way to put it. And again, the data really point to the fact that getting close to the specific details around those intrusive thoughts is going to be the best way to extinguish them.

Many, many people nowadays spend a lot of time looking at their smartphone, looking at the computer screen, looking at books and paper, in other words, looking at things somewhere between 9 inches away from their face and their eyes, maybe 2 and 1/2 feet away from their face and eyes. This is an unprecedented event in human history, as far as we know, because it wasn't until the advent of the smartphone that we've spent so much time looking at screens at close range relative to looking at things at further distances from our face throughout the day. In fact, it should come as no surprise that the incidence of myopia, of nearsightedness, is increasing dramatically around the world but is increasing particularly fast in children and in young adults and even in adults who are viewing things at very close range, so 2 and 1/2 feet or less. Now, I am not saying that viewing things"

        "source_doc": "Now, I am not saying that viewing things at 2 and 1/2 feet or less is bad for your eyes, that is simply not the case. However, if you want your vision to be maintained or even improve, it's going to be very important for you to view things at a distance as well for ideally several hours per day. Now, I realize some people just simply won't accomplish this. In fact, I'd like everyone to just take a moment and do a rough estimation in your head of how much time during your daytime activities you are viewing things at, say, 2 and 1/2 feet or 3 feet or less, so smartphone, computer screen, paper, books, et cetera, versus viewing things that are 4 feet away, 8 feet away, so maybe conversation across the table with another human being. Remember those? Some of us are doing that more now that we seem to be emerging from this whole pandemic phase. However, many people are still mostly just viewing things within very close range. And, in fact, if you were to ask yourself, how much time do you spend looking at things at the distance of many hundreds of feet, or taking a walk where you're not looking at any screen and you're simply letting visual images or the visual imagery rather pass by on your eyes, I think for most of us that number is getting progressively smaller and smaller with each passing year. So this is an issue because the structure of the eye is such that the lens of the eye can move, but also that the length of the eyeball from front to back is actually impacted by how close or how far you happen to view things during the course of your day, especially during development."

It's been performed in mice. It's also been performed on humans, where a visual occluder or a visual image. So an occluder is just a black screen or a piece of cardboard or an image, maybe some black and white checks or checkers, are placed at a certain distance from the eye, either up close or far away, and the impact of that on the length of the eyeball and on the structure of the lens and on the quality and acuity of vision is then measured. And to make a long story short, what these studies show is that, if during development, you or an animal exclusively looks at things that are up close, very close to the eye, and doesn't ever get long-range vision, the eyeball lengthens. And when that happens the lens, which, of course, is in the front of the eyeball, which focuses the light onto the back of the eyeball, which is where the so-called neural retina"

It lands too close or near the lens as opposed to on the back of the eyeball. And that's part of the reason what we call the consequence of that nearsighted myopia. In far sightedness, the opposite happens. The visual image is actually focused behind the retina. It doesn't land directly on the retina, which is what you want. It's focused too far behind the retina. And that's due to a shortening of the eyeball. So what I just described actually explains pretty well why kids who look at computer screens, or books up close often need glasses. When I was growing up, they called this nerd syndrome. Raising my hand for those of you that are listening. I read an awful lot, but I also spend time outside fortunately and running around on the soccer field and looking at things in the distance and playing in the neighborhood with my friends."

Kids that spend the vast amount of their time looking at things up close, and particularly children who do that indoors for most of their waking time, well, those kids develop myopia. This is part of the reason why we have such an increase of the incidence of myopia nowadays. What's interesting, and I think most people don't realize, is that even as a young adult and adult, and perhaps even as an older adult, an elderly person, looking at things up close to much at the expense of getting some time viewing things at a distance, in particular outdoors, can be very problematic because it can exacerbate myopia. So the short, direct prescription here is to make sure that you're getting at least an hour or so each day, although ideally it would be more, of long viewing. And that could be done by walking outside and avoiding looking at your phone while walking. It doesn't require that you look at a particular object in the distance, although if you are scanning for and looking for objects in the distance, the way that you might on a hike or you're looking out toward or off a vista or you're looking for someone in the distance, all of that sort of visual scanning behavior is going to be very good for your eye health and for maintaining vision at a distance.

        "source_doc": "If you're somebody who's far sighted and you have trouble seeing things up close, well, then you need to ask yourself whether or not you're spending too much time looking at things off in the distance, although I want to be very clear that nearsightedness and farsightedness aren't necessarily the consequence of this near, far viewing. There can be independent causes of nearsightedness and farsightedness. But for many people out there who are spending progressively more and more time just looking at things up close, you can get this lengthening of the eyeball or challenges in the way that the elasticity of the lens is controlled by the musculature in ways that make it hard to maintain sharp, crisp vision when you're looking at things at a distance or up close. So I can't, because there are simply no studies to support the idea that you need exactly two hours per day of outside long vision at a particular distance and/or that you want to cut off or have a threshold of four hours per day of looking at things up close, but we can say with a high degree of confidence that if you want to maintain or enhance your vision at all distances, that for every hour or so that you spend looking at things, say, a distance of 3 feet away or less, that you want to get at least one hour per day total, doesn't have to be all at once, of looking at things out in the distance or looking at things beyond 3 feet relative to the distance from your eye. So I think for some people who are already badly myopic, this isn't going to remedy that myopia. You're still going to need corrective lenses, but if you're somebody, similar to the person who asks the question, that they're quote unquote \"noticing\" their vision is deteriorating, really try and balance out the amount of viewing that you're doing"

        "source_doc": "Now, there's an additional behavioral tool that we can glean from the recent scientific literature exploring myopia which points to the fact that children who get two hours a day or more of time outside in sunlight-- one of my favorite topics. I know many people are probably rolling their eyes right now when they hear me say you really want to view morning sunlight, not through a window or windshield. Don't wear sunglasses for that, trying to get as much sunlight as you can in your eyes early in the day. Never stare at any light so bright it's painful, look at, et cetera. We've done a lot of episodes on this. We have a Light for Health episode, this Isn't All the Sleep episodes. It's just such a basic foundation of circadian rhythm and health that I just keep repeating it. However, there are also large-scale clinical trials involving thousands of subjects that have shown that people, children in particular, who get two hours or more of outside time every day have a much lower incidence of myopia. Now, what's really interesting about these studies is that, while some of those kids are looking at things further off in the distance than they would if they were indoors on their tablets or screens or with their nose in a book, it does not seem to be the case that they have to be looking at things in the distance in order to see this reduced incidence of myopia. What's probably happening instead is that the particular wavelengths of light that emanate from the sun, that photon energy in particular is triggering the activation of the so-called intrinsically sensitive melanopsin and retinal ganglion cells, which we know are important for setting circadian rhythm for enhancing mood focus and alertness during the day and enhancing the quality and duration of sleep at night.

So there are a lot of technical details there. In fact, I really hope to get the great Russell Van Gelder, or Dr. Russell Van Gelder, who's the chair of ophthalmology at the University of Washington in Seattle, who is a world expert in this and the various aspects, both molecular and structural of the ciliary body and the lens, and he's an expert in uveitis, a very interesting topic in its own, to come onto the podcast and talk more about eye health.

Meanwhile, if the first behavioral protocol for enhancing and maintaining eye health is to make sure that you're spending at least some time balancing out the near vision and far vision during the day, it also stands to reason that you want to get outside for at least two hours a day, which I know sounds like a lot, in order to prevent myopia, if you're a young person, and offset the progression of and maybe even reverse some myopia, we don't know yet based on the data, but there's some indication that's possible, by getting outside two hours a day. And the cool thing is, because many people, including myself, have a lot of work to do and we need to be on our phones quite a lot, or we choose to be on our phones quite a lot, this effect of getting sunlight outdoors during the daytime for two hours or more does not seem to require that you stay off your phone or tablet, or that you're looking at things far in the distance the entire time. What this means is, if you can get outside onto a patio or a deck or an outdoor table if you can, if weather and conditions permit, and do some of your phone time and computer time and reading, et cetera, outdoors. Now, if you're already making an effort to get outside, hike, play sports, take walks, et cetera, that of course counts towards this two hour threshold. And I know this sounds like a lot, this two hours, and yet for most people, it certainly will vary, depending on time of year, but I think striving to get on average about two hours of outdoor time as much as you can or opening a window, which wouldn't be as good as getting outside, but opening a window and trying to get some natural light exposure to the eye to trigger the"

And actually, the lens of the eye has its own flexibility. It's a really, really interesting structure. I'll geek out on this far too long if I don't prevent myself from doing so, but the lens is just incredible. The fact that it has a specific structure of proteins like crystallines and things of that sort and that it can still derive nourishment from blood flow but does not actually have vasculature within it. So it's not-- if you notice the lens of your eyes and filled with blood vessels and capillaries because it needs light to pass through, super interesting structure I think the only violation of what I just said is the manatee. Those pigs are underwater, elephant-like creatures that I think were or are endangered. Down in Florida, they were getting chopped up by speedboats, but I think now there's some effort to preserve those big gentle giants. The manatee, as I recall, has a vascularized lens, which is why their eyes look opaque. It looks like they have cataracts. In any case, you're not a manatee. You have no blood vessel supply to the lens. Keeping that lens clear is vital nowadays. They can do lens replacement. There's really a pretty incredible progress in the realm of ophthalmology and surgical replacement of the lens or the cornea, other aspects of the eye. But if you're somebody who is interested in maintaining your vision, you're going to want to maintain the musculature that controls the movement and the change of shape in that lens and the movement of the eyes, which allows you to transition your vision from very sharp when viewing things up close to very sharp one viewing things at a distance.

Saccades are when you dart your eyes to a particular location to look at something that dart it to another location to look at something. Microsaccades are little, tiny versions of those that were doing most all of the time, believe it or not. When you look at a visual scene or image, if you did not have those little microsaccades, your brain would adapt or would attenuate to whatever you were looking at, and the visual image would actually disappear, which really speaks to how important it is that your perceptions change in order to maintain them. This is very similar to where if something is placed on your hand, say a finger, you'll notice that change, but then if you leave it there for a short while, you'll forget that it's there because the cells there have adapted out. There's no change. So your nervous system is largely responding to change. This is also why when you walk into a room and you'll often notice a novel smell, let's hope it's a good smell, after a few minutes or so, you don't notice the smell anymore because your olfactory system adapted that away. So a lot of that adaptation is prevented by those little microsaccades. And the macrosaccades, the bigger saccades, are really for moving your eyes around to look for things in visual space. Smooth pursuit is a very particular kind of visual behavior that you can do in a smooth pursuit task and zero cost. Costs a little bit of time I suppose to do this on YouTube. And most any of them will do.

And, of course, you do smooth pursuit when you move about your day, but for people that are trying to offset or reverse vision loss, doing some additional deliberate smooth pursuit exercises can be useful. The other visual exercise that can be very useful is the so-called near-far exercise. So this is best accomplished, I think, by holding out a pen or pencil in front of your eyes, in front of your head, and focusing very intensely through what's called a vergence eye movement, where you bring both eyes to the tip of the pen and then moving that pen closer and closer and closer to your eyes, where you get close enough that you actually have to deliberately bring your eyes-- for those of you listening, this is what I'm doing right now-- to the point where it's blurry and you can no longer hold it in sharp, crisp relief. You can't see it sharply that is. And then you can move it out a little bit distance and play right around that threshold where it's hard to keep it in focus and then move it back out again. And then in doing that for even a minute or two, you'll find is a bit of a strain on your eyes, but you can actually build up the musculature and the neuromuscular connections that allow you to do that more efficiently. And that has been shown to improve certain aspects of vision, especially when people are diligent about doing those exercises, not necessarily every day, but let's say three days a week or so.

That could be a very lengthy conversation, but let's just summarize it with a few brief points that we know stand based on the clinical and scientific research. We've all heard that carrots are good for your eyes. Well, it's not carrots per se that are good for your eyes. It's vitamin A that's essential for the so-called phototransduction cascade. The phototransduction cascade is the process by which the photoreceptors, which are in the back of the retina, at least if you're human, they're in the back of the retina, take photons, light energy, and convert it into electrical signals that's then conveyed to the other cells and neurons within the retina and then passed into the brain to create visual perceps. Most people can't get enough of this fat soluble vitamin, we call vitamin A, by making sure that they eat at least some dark green leafy vegetables. And that they do that in their closest to raw form, maybe cooked a little bit but not overly cooked. There are other sources of vitamin A out. There you can look those up online just for sources of vitamin A. Most people will be able to get enough vitamin A from their nutrition and won't require it from a supplement, provided that it's not present at excessively high levels in a foundational supplement or vitamin mineral supplement. Getting some additional vitamin A from a foundational supplement or vitamin mineral supplement is probably not going to be an issue unless you really take in far too much of that vitamin A. It could potentially provide some insurance. But, again, I think most people can get enough vitamin A from their"

Liver is somewhat of a popular/controversial organ meat in the nutrition space for reasons that aren't interesting, for sake of this discussion anyway I suppose for those of you that like liver, you could eat a little bit of liver every once in a while. It is rich in a number of things that are beneficial to health, although for you vegans out there, I'm sure you'll want to avoid liver entirely. I avoid liver because I just simply don't like the way it tastes. Maybe once or twice I've tasted liver that was appetizing to me. And it can be OK, but it's just not, or at least by my read it, can be OK, but it's not a food that I actively seek out, order, or prepare for myself on a regular basis. So fortunately, there are other sources of vitamin A as well. And, again, I just invite you to all put into a web search food sources of vitamin and figure out how to get your daily dose of vitamin A by taking in foods that you like for you. And then in terms of supplementation of things that can enhance vision, this is a newer area. And frankly, it's an area where most of the data point to some supplements that can potentially be beneficial in certain disease conditions.

But the data on this are still emerging. I consulted with our chair of ophthalmology at Stanford about lutein and some of the other things that you'll see out there, like zeaxanthin and astaxanthins.

I don't dispute those claims, but as of now, there aren't many papers, I could only find about 4, 3 really solid ones and then a fourth, that point to the specific disease instances where supplementing with lutein, zeaxanthin, or astaxanthin can be beneficial for slowing the progression of things like advanced onset age-related macular degeneration. And the degree of offset for that macular degeneration was slight. It wasn't enormous, but it was robust enough that it warranted reporting in the paper. Or things like Lieber's, which is a particular eye disease. It impacts a whole different set of systems in the eye. So basically, what I'm trying to say is, when it comes to supplements to support eye health, make sure you're getting enough vitamin A from your diet. If you're not, consider supplementation or consider changing your diet somewhat to make sure you can get that lutein and vitamin A. And if you are interested in it, and it's within your budget, I don't know of any evidence that supplementing with additional lutein, zeaxanthin, and astaxanthin can be dangerous at all. So for those of you that are really interested in maintaining or improving your vision, that"

        "source_doc": "at all. So for those of you that are really interested in maintaining or improving your vision, that might be an area that you want to explore. I personally am not taking lutein, zeaxanthin, or astaxanthin, at least not at this time. I do take a foundational supplement, which is my source of vitamin A in addition to my food sources. But I don't suffer from vision loss anywhere, readers at night, and I have for a long time. I have a little bit of a muscular weakness in one of my eyes that originated in childhood. So occasionally, if I get very fatigued, one of my eyes will deviate a little bit, a little bit of almost strabismus, especially if I've been awake for very long periods of time. It tends to recover once I get a good night's sleep. Some of you that have experienced this, where you have one eye that might just drift a little bit. I could do this for the camera if you want. OK, this is weird. I used to do this to my sister across the table when we were at a friend's houses for dinner. So I can actually move one of my eyes in like this, which actually just reflects that there's a extraocular muscle closer to my nose. It's rather weak, which allows me to do that. I can't do it so well with the opposite eye. Anyway, now I need to blink to clear my vision. But the point is that, if you're somebody who has a slightly deviating eye, slightly, often if you go to the ophthalmologist or optometrist, they're going to give you a prism lens which is going to redirect the image onto that slightly deflected eyeball. One thing you'll really want to discuss with that ophthalmologist or optometrist is whether or not there are exercises"

        "qns": "Can exercises be done to improve vision without the need for prism lenses?",
        "source_doc": "really want to discuss with that ophthalmologist or optometrist is whether or not there are exercises that you could do to overcome that issue without the need for a prism because what I saw and what many other people see when they put on a prism lens is that indeed it can line up their vision or their visual perception better, but indeed, it can lead to progressive weakening of the muscle further and further. So then that eyeball starts to deviate further and further. And that raises a larger question, which is, should we wear corrective lenses? In fact, if you go online, you'll find or hear about these examples of people that stopped wearing their corrective lenses, their glasses or contacts, in order to bring their vision back or improve their vision on their own. Now, if your vision is quite impaired, you're going to need corrective lenses or contacts. However, there are a number of people out there who find that if their vision is somewhat impaired, that forcing themselves to view things at a distance to do smooth pursuit, to do near far, and to make sure that they're getting adequate nutrition and things of that sort, can all sum to help offset some of the visual impairment that would occur if they were to just pop glasses on their face and rely on the corrective lenses in order to focus the light onto the correct area within the eye onto the neural retina. So I'm not telling people to throw off or get rid of their corrective lenses and contacts, but you can be overly reliant on these things, like a crutch, in a way that perhaps you want to do a little bit of work to try and overcome and then maybe work with a weaker prescription. And certainly, in the case of prism lenses, what I mentioned before is a real consideration. It's one I'm very familiar with. So as a last but I think very important and exciting feature of visual improvement is red"

        "source_doc": "familiar with. So as a last but I think very important and exciting feature of visual improvement is red light. I talked a little bit about this on the episode of the Huberman Lab podcast all about light and health. There's some really spectacular, I think I consider it spectacular, many other people consider it spectacular, research out of University College London. And the work I'm referring to is Glenn Jeffrey's work. I've known Glenn for a long time. These are animal studies, and now two human studies, exploring how exposure to red light early in the day can offset some of the vision loss related to age-related macular degeneration, or simply age-related visual decline. There's a whole mechanism here that's discussed in that episode, but it has to do with the fact that red light and near-infrared light, together, or maybe even separately, when viewed for even just a minute to 3 minutes once, or maybe two or three times per week maximum, can actually reduce the number of what are called reactive oxygen species in the photoreceptors that convert photons into electrical signals the rest of the visual system can understand. So that's a mouthful. Basically what they found was, for people 40 years or older, if they viewed this red light at a distance of about a foot and a half, although I wouldn't get too specific with this, for a few minutes each week total, they were able to offset some of the vision loss within a particular domain of vision. And I don't have time to go into the details here because I do that in the Light for Health episode, but you have different types of photoreceptors, cones, and rods. You have different types of cone photoreceptors that respond to different wavelengths of light, short, medium, and long wavelengths of light so-called blue, green, and red cones, they're sometimes called. When these people"

        "source_doc": "of light so-called blue, green, and red cones, they're sometimes called. When these people who are 40 years or older viewed red light on a consistent basis early in the day, and it did have to be early in the day, there was a real circadian effect there, there was a offset of some of the vision loss that would normally occur in a particular wavelength of light range that resulted in better visual acuity overall. So if you're very concerned about your vision, or you're into red light therapies, et cetera, there are a number of different red light devices out there. At some future point, the Huberman Lab podcast may partner with one of these red light companies. So right now, I'm not going to mention any of them in particular. They're prominent online. What you're looking for is a red light unit that provides red light and maybe far-- near infrared-- excuse me-- light as well. So something in the 650 to 720 ish nanometer range. So really it's going to look red or almost invisible to you if it's really far into the infrared. And you'll want to view that at a distance of about a foot and a half to 2 feet. And you don't want it to be so bright that it's painful to look at because you don't want to damage your eyes. But that's essentially what they used in these studies from the Jeffrey lab. And they showed some pretty impressive offset of some of the aspects of vision loss in these people 40 and older. So that's an area that you may want to explore as well, especially for folks 40 and older. And, again, this red light exposure had to be done early in the day. So hopefully, that collection of behavioral tools near, far, smooth pursuit, some of the discussion about lutein, nutrition, vitamin"

To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these Ask Me Anything sessions, plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the Huberman Lab podcast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. Just to remind you why we launched the Huberman Lab podcast premium channel, it's really twofold. First of all, it's to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which, of course, will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length. We are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast, and to fund research, in particular research done on human beings, so not animal models but on human beings, which I think we all agree is the species that we are most interested in. And we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance. And those protocols will be distributed through all channels, not just the premium channel but through all channels, Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. So the idea"

So the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions, in depth, and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the tiny foundation has generously offered to do dollar-for-dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel. So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science-related tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to sign up for the Huberman Lab Premium channel, again, there's a cost of $10 per month, or you can pay $100 up front for the entire year. That will give you access to all the AMAs. You can ask questions and get answers to your questions, and you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well. There will also be some premium content such as transcripts of the AMAs and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman Lab podcast episodes and not found elsewhere. And, again, you'll be supporting research for mental health, physical health, and performance. You can sign up for the premium channel by going to hubermanlab.com/premium. Again, that's hubermanlab.com/premium. And as always, thank you for your interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]"
