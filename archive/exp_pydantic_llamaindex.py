158.98: "So I'll get into the details\nof how to use ultradian rhythms", 162.52: 'to best capture\nneuroplasticity--', 164.528: "that is the brain's ability\nto change in response", 166.57: 'to experience-- and in a way\nthat should allow you to get', 170.47: 'one or two, or maybe even three\nfocused bouts of learning per', 174.7: 'day, which can greatly\naccelerate learning', 176.83: 'of

skill learning in\nthe physical domain as well.', 187.9: 'Jackson then went on to ask--', 189.43: "you've mentioned\nbefore that you try", 190.93: 'to include at least one\n90-minute focus block per day', 193.572: 'as part of your work\nand overall mission.', 195.28: 'And indeed, that is true.', 196.42: 'I tried to get at least one of\nthese focused ultradian rhythm', 199.42: 'blocks per day.', 200.98: 'That is a period\nof about 90 minutes', 204.19: "where I'm focused on learning\nsomething or doing something", 206.71: "that's cognitively hard,\nalthough typically I", 209.17: 'aim for two of these\nsessions per day.', 211.51: 'He then goes on to ask-- what\nis the maximum number of blocks', 214.21: 'you can perform sustainably?', 216.16: 'The answer to that\nis probably four.', 219.4:

would be the maximum.', 259.06: 'You then went on to ask--\ndo you take vacations', 261.22: 'or extended breaks from these\nultradian rhythm sessions?', 264.55: 'And the short answer is no.', 267.13: 'Typically, I try and do this\nevery day-- and yes, even', 269.793: 'on the weekends.', 270.46: 'But on the weekend,\nthe ultradian rhythm', 272.77: 'focused learning\nbout might just be', 274.36:

do think that the\ncircuits for focus are,', 295.36: 'I guess the non-biological way\nto put it would be kept warm.', 298.12: 'But essentially, that accessing\nthe circuits for focus', 301.36: 'is made easier by\naccessing them regularly', 304.182: "and that's because\nthe circuits for focus", 305.89: 'are indeed themselves\namenable to neuroplasticity.', 309.68: 'In other words, the more\nyou force yourself to focus,', 312.17: 'the easier focusing gets.', 314.015: "I'll now answer the last\npart of the question", 315.89: 'and then I will go through\nand emphasize some tools', 318.89: 'that anyone can use in order\nto leverage ultradian rhythms', 322.61: 'toward learning bouts--\neither cognitive learning', 325.52: 'or physical skill learning,\nor a combination of the two.', 328.978: 'The last part of the\nquestion Jackson asked', 330.77: 'was-- if you knew you needed\nto drastically increase', 333.41: 'the amount of focus you do\ndaily, how would you schedule', 336.11: 'that focus and recover from it?', 338.21: "That's an excellent\naspect to this question.", 341.27: 'And I will now give\nyou the details', 343.19: 'of how I would use and\nschedule ultradian rhythms.', 346.13: "I'll offer you a tool--", 347.15: "I've never talked about this\ntool in the Huberman Lab", 349.07: 'podcast.', 349.73: 'And I will dispel a common myth\nabout ultradian rhythms that', 353.3: 'points to a, believe it or\nnot, an easier way to leverage', 356.42: 'them for maximum benefit.', 358.18: 'OK.', 358.68: 'So as I mentioned before,\nultradian rhythms are', 360.71: 'these 90-minute cycles that\nwe go through from the time', 363.77: 'that we are born\nuntil the time we die.', 366.2: 'Indeed, even during\nsleep, we are', 368.99: 'experiencing and\nmore or less governed', 371.33: 'by these ultradian rhythms.', 373.25: 'This question and this answer\nis not so much about sleep.', 376.023: 'But just know that when you\ngo to sleep at night until you', 378.44: 'wake up in the morning,\nevery 90 minutes or so,', 380.84: 'your patterns of sleep-- that is\nthe percentage or ratio rather', 384.65: 'of slow wave sleep to light\nsleep to rapid eye movement', 387.41: 'sleep changes in a way such\nthat each 90-minute cycle gates', 392.905: 'the next cycle.', 393.53: 'It flips on switch for\nthe next 90-minute cycle', 396.41: 'then that 90-minute\ncycle ends, flips', 398.36: 'on switch for the next one,\nand so on and so forth.', 400.5: 'I mentioned all that\nbecause during the daytime,', 402.5: 'the same thing is true.', 404.42: "But most people don't know\nwhen the 90-minute all trading", 407.72: 'cycles begin.', 408.793: 'Because if you\nthink about it, you', 410.21: 'could wake up on the\nbasis of an alarm clock', 413.81: 'or noise in the room, or\nsimply because you naturally', 416.72: 'wake up in the middle of an\nultradian 90-minute cycle.', 420.21: 'So does that mean, for instance,\nthat if you wake up 60 minutes', 424.28: 'into an ultradian cycle\nthat the next 30 minutes', 427.43: 'of your waking--', 428.6: 'right, because that\n60 minutes needs', 430.31: 'to continue to 90 to\ncomplete an ultradian', 432.17: 'cycle-- that the next\n30 minutes after waking', 435.65: 'are related to the\nultradian cycle', 438.47: 'that you were still in\nduring sleep, or does', 441.5: 'it start a new ultradian cycle.', 443.81: 'And the answer is the former.', 445.31: 'That ultradian cycle\ncontinues even if you wake up', 448.25: 'in the middle of it.', 449.52: 'And so a lot of people who want\nto leverage ultradian cycles', 452.133: 'for learning will say, "Well,\nhow do I know when to start?', 454.55: 'When does it start,\nwhen I hit my stopwatch?', 456.44: 'Can I just set a clock\nand work for 90 minutes?"', 458.75: 'And the short answer is no.', 460.62: 'And that might seem\nunfortunate, but the good news', 463.28: 'is that you can figure out when\nyour first proper ultradian', 468.14: 'cycle of the day begins simply\nby asking yourself when are', 471.95: 'you most alert after waking.', 474.53: 'That is if you were, say\nto wake up at 7:00 AM', 477.23: "and let's say that's the end of\nan ultradian cycle or perhaps", 480.71: "you're in the middle\nof an ultradian cycle--", 482.58: "doesn't matter.", 484.07: 'What you need to watch\nfor or pay attention to', 486.35: 'for a day or so\nis when you start', 488.24: 'to experience your greatest\nstate of mental alertness', 492.38: 'in the morning.', 493.2: 'And here, we can discard with\nall the issues and variables', 495.68: 'around caffeine or no caffeine,\nhydrating or no hydrating.', 499.13: "Exercise is one variable that\nwe'll consider in a moment.", 502.62: "But here's the deal--", 504.56: 'these all trading in cycles\nare actually triggered', 507.56: 'by fluctuations in the so-called\nglucocorticoid system--', 512.36: 'the system that regulates\ncortisol release.', 515.12: 'And as some of you have\nprobably heard me say before--', 518.48: "cortisol, even though it's often\ndiscussed as a terrible thing,", 521.6: "it's chronic stress, cortisol,\ncortisol, et cetera-- cortisol", 525.02: 'is essential for\nhealth and every day we', 527.45: 'get a rise in cortisol in the\nmorning that is associated', 531.02: 'with enhanced immune function,\nenhanced alertness, enhanced', 534.02: 'ability to focus,\nso on and so forth.', 536.37: "In fact, the protocol\nthat I'm always", 538.033: 'beating the drum\nabout that people', 539.45: 'should get sunlight\nin their eyes', 541.1: 'as close to waking as possible--\nthat actually enhances', 543.83: "or increases the peak\nlevel of cortisol that's", 546.71: 'experienced early in the day.', 548.54: 'And that sets in motion a number\nof these ultradian cycles.', 551.34: 'So for instance, if\nyou wake up at 7:00 AM', 553.28: 'and you find that for the\nfirst hour after waking,', 555.86: 'you tend to be a\nlittle bit groggy,', 557.99: 'or you happen to be\ngroggy on a given day,', 560.18: 'but then you notice that your\nattention and alertness starts', 563.06: 'to peak somewhere around\n9:30 AM or 10:00 AM,', 567.17: 'you can be pretty sure\nthat, that first ultradian', 571.04: 'cycle for learning is going\nto be optimal to start', 574.49: 'at about 9:30 or 10:00 AM.', 576.65: "How can I say about if it's\nindeed a 90-minute cycle?", 580.34: 'Well, this is really where\nthe underlying neurobiology', 583.853: 'in these ultradian cycles\nconverge to give you', 585.77: 'a specific protocol.', 587.0: 'The changes in cortisol that\noccur throughout the day', 589.4: 'involve--', 589.94: "yes, a big peak early\nin the day if you're", 591.69: 'getting your sunlight and\ncaffeine and maybe even some', 594.14: 'exercise early in the day.', 595.73: 'But typically, that\npeak comes early.', 598.04: 'And then across the day the\nbaseline jitters a little bit,', 601.13: 'it comes down, but it\nbounces around a little bit.', 603.23: "It's not a flat line,\nif we were to measure",

9:30', 616.31: 'or starting to\nbecome alert at 9:30,', 618.32: 'and then typically you have a\npeak of focus and concentration', 621.05: 'around 10:00 AM, that is\nreally valuable to know.', 625.07:

the point is this--', 702.5: 'these 90-minute cycles\noccur periodically', 704.69: 'throughout the day,\nbut there is going', 706.34: 'to be one period\nearly in the day--', 707.988: "and here, I'm
